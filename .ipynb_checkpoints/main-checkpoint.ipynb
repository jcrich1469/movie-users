We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.\\n\\nThis adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.\\n\\nThe stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.\\n\\nI do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.\\n\\nBut in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind.

Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :) Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes.

One of the best actors in the show, hands down.\\n\\n(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)\", '8/10', 'February 2024')\n",

Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion.

The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!\\n\\nAang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.\\n\\nThe only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.\\n\\nAlso it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.\", '5/10', 'February 2024')\n",

But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standouts\\n\\nThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful benders\\n\\nThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatch\\n\\nBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original's\\n\\nI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1.

I decided to check on one of the writers and listened to her story about how she got into the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a fan fiction and rom-com enthusiast, and was solely focused on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the brainstorm room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics affected the show.\\n\\nThe live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out by lazily cramming in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang, chopping and mixing up the reunion with Bumi and the Gaang, expunging developed habits like Katara's nagging and Sokka's negative thinking, rewriting Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim, politicizing an ancient Earth Kingdom legend, revealing Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself too early, cutting out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding, deleting subtleties like Katara's necklace that affect Pakku's arc, swapping Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance, disclosing the comet that was part of an investigation, etc.\\n\\nThere is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. From playing with his airball buddies to losing them due to his avatar status to shirking his duties says a lot more than delivering a speech. This happens in each episode if not in every scene, but it does seem to happen in modern television, so the fault lies in the writers and maybe the editors. By choosing the least creative path, you are robbing the viewer the chance to fantasize and to be fascinated. There is no shame in following the superior version down to its dialogue and screenplays.\\n\\nAaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. It should be clear by now that you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.\", '3/10', 'February 2024')\n",

They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.\\n255 out of 411 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.\\nPermalink\", '3/10', 'February 2024')\n",

Showing that being the avatar is not all fun and games and antics, it's also not about facing dangers alone. The bending in this is a thousand times better than what Shyamalon did, at least these people kept the bending art, even make it a little more realistic with movements. I can't wait to see what more adventures await the series, what Togh will be like, Ba Sing Sa, metal bending, Zuko teaming up with Team Avatar.\\n38 out of 62 found this helpful.

      "(22, 9018736, 140147750329104, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender is based off the animated series of the same name. It takes place in a world that is divided into 4 different nations, each nation is made up of an element (Fire, Water, Air and Earth). The Avatar is the only one who can master all 4 elements and the one who brings balance between all the nations until one day the Fire Nation decides to invade. The Avatar is the only one who can stop them but he suddenly disappears. A hundred years later a new Avatar named, Aang, emerges. With some help from friends he must master the elements to bring peace and balance back to the world. I have to admit that I've never seen the animated series or movie so I went into this with no expectations or prior knowledge of the series. I've read good things and the trailer looked good so I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it. I thought it was going to be more aimed to younger audiences but it's enjoyable for everyone.\\n9 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance.
