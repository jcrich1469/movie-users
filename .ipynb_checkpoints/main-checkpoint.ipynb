Maybe the producers will learn from this and bring the guy back. By the way, it didn\\'t deserve all those \"One\" ratings. There were some incredible scenes. It just didn\\'t meld.\\n186 out of 300 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.\\nPermalink'}\n",

      "{'ratings': '7/10', 'title': 'niceeee one', 'movie_id': '1825683', 'author': 'epistimistavrou6', 'date': 'March 2023', 'content': '\"Black Panther\" follows some typical superhero plot points, but it does make a few changes along the way. Perhaps the biggest is in how the villain is represented. He doesn\\'t really play a big part until close to an hour into the film. Until then, we are entertained by a more minor villain named Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis). There are several stabs at humor (not unusual for a Marvel flick), and thankfully the jokes are very good-natured and funny.\\n\\nSpeaking of the villain, he\\'s one of the most interesting villains Marvel\\'s put together. He\\'s given interesting reasons behind taking over Wakanda. Michael B. Jordan gives an energetic performance that adds a layer or two more than what you might expect a villain to have. As for Boseman, he aptly provides the heart and soul of the strong but gentle-hearted character. Lupita N\\'yongo gives a memorable performance as the kind Nakia. Movie fans and \"Lord of the Rings\"/\"Hobbit\" fans, may be excited to see Martin Freeman (reprising from \"Civil War\") and Serkis together again in an interesting scene. There are a lot of characters to keep up with, however. This makes veteran actors such as Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker have less screentime than people might have hoped for.\\n\\nLudwig Gorannson\\'s score cleverly mixes African beats with some orchestral pieces. The production design and costume design carry bits and pieces of originality and uniqueness. The visual effects, like most superhero movies, are impressive, but sometimes over-the-top. The action sequences are exciting, but the camera work is a bit shaky in places.\\n\\nAs for the usual Marvel elements, Stan Lee\\'s cameo doesn\\'t disappoint. And the second post-credits scene is worth waiting for.'}\n",

      "{'ratings': '6/10', 'title': \"Doesn't quite reign king\", 'movie_id': '1825683', 'author': 'TheLittleSongbird5', 'date': 'March 2018', 'content': \"Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more.\\n\\nMy thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.\\n\\nStarting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.\\n\\nMuch of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant.\\n\\nPersonally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception).\\n\\n'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clichéd, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept.\\n\\nThere are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well.\\n\\nAlthough some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy.\\n\\nOverall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox\"}\n",

Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.\\n\\nPros: Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.\\n\\nAs expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther.\\n\\nCons: The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better.\\n\\nOverall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain.\\n\\nBlack Panther gets an A.\"}\n",

To have a story so explicit about the historical treatment of African peoples and the plight of African communities around the world as a main stream cinematic event is a breath of fresh air.\\n\\nThere are numerous strong, positive, non-clichéd, male and female African characters, in a movie led by an African Marvel superhero.

Brave and brilliant, this superhero movie is like nothing you've ever seen before.\", 'movie_id': '1825683', 'author': 'shawneofthedead10', 'date': 'March 2018', 'content': \"Superhero movies never get a fair shake. There's always been an invisible - but undeniable - whiff of critical disdain attached to films revolving around people with superhuman abilities. More often than not, these films are viewed (and assessed) as popcorn entertainment: good fun, but not objectively good. Even the best examples of the genre are rarely, if ever, taken seriously by critics or award shows. But all that is set to change with Black Panther - a bold, brilliant blockbuster teeming with ideas, characters and messages that will make your soul take flight. For once, it's no exaggeration to say that you've never seen or experienced anything like this before.\\n\\nThe film gets off to a somewhat sedate start, as we're re-introduced to T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the freshly crowned King of Wakanda who is also infused with the ancestral powers of his nation's panther god. Writer-director Ryan Coogler takes his time in introducing us to all the key players in the film's first act, from the most important members of T'Challa's royal court to the rites, rituals and rigidity of Wakanda itself.\\n\\nIt's never boring, but Black Panther does linger in a minor key for a while. You might find yourself wondering just where the film is going, as T'Challa deals with a challenge to his authority from within Wakanda's five tribes. It can be hard to imagine, too, just what the film wants to say when T'Challa - who could easily delegate the responsibility - takes it upon himself to personally hunt down dastardly arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to retrieve a stolen artifact made of Wakanda's most precious natural resource, vibranium.\\n\\nBut put your trust in Coogler - he's certainly earned it with his masterful blending of tension, character and story in his previous two films, Fruitvale Station and Creed. As Black Panther unfolds, everything starts to make a whole lot of sense, in dramatic, emotional and narrative terms. Suddenly, we're not just witnessing the growing pains of a new king. As it turns out, Black Panther is, for its titular character, an existential odyssey: as he fights for his nation's survival, T'Challa must also grapple with the choices (and sins) of his ancestors, deciding whether to embrace or reject them.\\n\\nMost significantly, Black Panther uses its blockbuster platform to examine complex issues such as racism and colonialism in thoughtful, intimate ways. The fiction of Wakanda - a hyper-evolved African nation that has kept its technological advances a secret from the rest of the world for centuries - allows Coogler to hold up a mirror to the facts of the world in which we live. In quite unprecedented fashion, we are presented with a host of proud, brave, indomitable African warriors who have lived their lives free of the horrors of slavery and institutionalised racism. Just as Wonder Woman gave little girls the world over a hero in their own image, Black Panther will do the same for generations of black children who have never before seen themselves represented on screen.\\n\\nIf that sounds impossibly weighty and grim, don't worry. Coogler's script, co-written with Joe Robert Cole, is far from preachy. There may be a hint or two of hand-wringing melodrama to T'Challa's central dilemma - should Wakanda venture out into the world and lead by example? - but it's cleverly off-set by the depths of darkness and despair written into T'Challa's nemesis: Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan). Shaped by the very different circumstances of their lives, one man turns towards the light, and the other away from it - and yet, neither man falls simply into the black-and-white categories of 'hero' or 'villain'. Somehow, Coogler shades centuries of history and hope into the conflict at the heart of their troubled relationship.\\n\\nBlack Panther is no slouch, either, when it comes to turning up the heat in terms of action and spectacle. There's a jaw-dropping car chase through the neon-washed streets of Busan that's easily one of the most exhilarating scenes you'll see all year. Fight scenes are pulled off with remarkable flair, particularly when it comes to the swift military precision of the Dora Milaje - an incredibly cool, all-female special forces unit devoted to the protection of Wakanda's monarch. Wakanda itself is an eye-popping fantasy scape: a heady blend of futuristic elements and African traditons, colours and music.\\n\\nLeading the film's top-notch ensemble, Boseman is the film's quiet backbone: an invaluable presence and the reason everything holds together at all. He shares an electric chemistry with Jordan, who blends swagger, menace and pathos in creating the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most complex, nuanced and sympathetic antagonist to date.\\n\\nFantastic as the two leading men, however, they're not the breakout stars of the film. That honour belongs to a trio of female characters - each one given depth, layers and a fierce, real on-screen presence that's still rare enough that they shouldn't be taken for granted. Lupita Nyong'o injects strength and steel into her portrayal of Nakia - a former and future love interest for T'Challa who manages to be interesting in her own right. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira is a force to be reckoned with as Okoye, the righteous leader of the Dora Milaje; while Letitia Wright's Shuri - T'Challla's younger sister who also happens to be Wakanda's premier scientist - waltzes away with every scene in which she appears.\\n\\nIt may come as a surprise to some that Marvel's latest superhero blockbuster tackles issues of race, representation and discrimination in so bold and unflinching a manner.

Watching this 8 years later as a grown adult, I can say that I totally understand why this movie became a phenomenon.\\n\\nFrozen has three big things going for it...the songs, the characters and the interesting subversion of tropes. I personally don\\'t *love* all of them, but the musical numbers give the movie a bouncy, fun vibe. The characters are lovable and well written; it\\'s hard not to like SOMEONE here, if not the entire roster of characters.\\n\\nThe Bad: I don\\'t think the movie does a great job with establishing the central conflict. Despite the first portion of the movie covering it, by the time the movie gets into it, I just didn\\'t buy the relationship between Anna and Elsa until the halfway mark of the movie. Anna\\'s motivations are quite poor and while I get that we wouldn\\'t have a movie without this central conflict, it could have been communicated with a bit more patience.\\n\\nThis might also be a nitpick, but I also felt the environment lacked a real presence; Arendelle sort of gave me \"Asgard\" vibes, which means: devoid of people, we move on from it too fast and it doesn\\'t feel like a living breathing world. Maybe it\\'s the cold setting, but I prefer my fantasy worlds to be brimming with life and character.\\n\\nThe Ugly: Yeah, it\\'s good. I still think Let It Go is a bit overrated and I\\'ve definitely seen better looking animated films, but Frozen is a solid movie and fun for the whole family.'}\n",

      "{'ratings': '9/10', 'title': 'Let the storm range on!', 'movie_id': '2294629', 'author': 'nataliabatsko25', 'date': 'January 2022', 'content': \"Walt Disney is one of, if not, the most popular animation studio of all time.\\n\\nEveryone has watched at least one Disney movie in their life, and today's review is going to be about their highest grossing animated movie of all time (outside of it's sequel and the remake of Lion king).\\n\\nThe story is loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's Snow queen and is set in the Kingdom of Arendelle. There were 2 young princesses - Anna and Elsa, the latter one had snowy magical powers who sadly led the former's life to no good, thus separating the two when they were kids. Years passed, and Elsa has her coronation ceremony, and Anna meets her love at first sight - Prince Hans. When Anna asks her older sister to engage them, she says that you can't marry a man that you just met (and she was right actually). Sadly the princess and the queen argue and Elsa freezes her kingdom on accident. As a result, Anna has to go to the north mountain to return her sister back. On her way, she meets Kristoff, a man who works on the lake to sell ice, his reindeer pet Sven who adores carrots and a lovely snowman Olaf who loves warm hugs.\\n\\nLike most Disney movies, this is a musical and has 10 songs in total. Of course we can't talk about this movie without mentioning Let it go performed by Idina Menzel and Demi Lovato. It's a song about escaping from the sad past and being free! This song won an Oscar for best original song and I can see why. My favorite song other then let it go has to be for the first time in forever performed by Kristen bell. It's a very happy one where Anna is so excited for the coronation because finally the gates have open. The sad thing is that unlike let it go, it doesn't have it's pop music counterpart, which could be performed by either Selena Gomez or Miley Cyrus or even Taylor swift (Because the first 2 were working on Disney channel with Demi back in late 2000s). Other songs include In summer, Love is an open door, Reindeers are better than people, fixer upper and do you want to build a snowman are also great, each in their own way. The only exception is the first song, it's not terrible and it's actually ok as it's own song, but comparing it to others, it's easily the weakest in my opinion (the one where Kristoff is a kid doing the ice work and men singing about cold winter) As for the characters, each one is important. With the two sisters, Elsa is the one who didn't have the best childhood, as she had to keep her powers under control otherwise she may hurt someone. As for Anna, she's the complete opposite of her sister because she's very optimistic and naive in the contrast of Elsa's seriousness and anxiety. Anna believes in love and that she can fix anything, she's also a little bit stubborn, because listening to others isn't exactly her thing, thus preferring to do things her own way. Kinda reminds me of Rapunzel from Tangled. Olaf is easily the cutest Disney sidekick ever created. He's a little snowman who dreams about summer and adores warm hugs. Kristoff is one of Anna's friends she meets and he's a little bit pessimistic, but still helpful on her journey. Also Hans is the guest from the southern islands who really likes Anna and tries to take care of the town while she's gone. But I won't tell you what happens to him afterwards, because if I do, it may ruin a surprise for you. There are also secondary characters including Duke of Weaseltown (or Wesseltown), Oaken the salesman, the rock trolls and a giant snowman named Marshmallow. Not as memorable as the main ones, but still very important.\\n\\nLast things last, let's talk about it's animation. It's absolutely beautiful. There's lot's of details in every chunk of ice, in every piece of clothing and even a strand of hair. The backgrounds are gorgeous to look at, especially during winter scenes! The designs are great too. It stays true to both Disney and Norwegian styles, which makes this film stand out from the rest. The ice castle that Elsa created is probably the best element of the animation, it took somewhere from 5 to 9 months to animate 15 seconds of it's building, which is astounding in my opinion.\\n\\nThe best thing I can say about it is that this is Disney's greatest film since the lion king and truly deserves the title of the best animated feature of 2013. I recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen this masterpiece, especially Disney fans and young girls. But I think even people outside the demographic will appreciate it too. A must see movie!\\n\\nThe cold never bothered me anyway!\"}\n",

Sadly, I didn't see Frozen when it was in theaters. The main reason was I didn't really pay much attention to advertisement for the movie. After hearing how Frozen was getting reviews about how amazing it was, I bought the Blu- Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo pack in April last year. When I watched the movie, I thought Frozen was a decent entry to the Disney library.\\n\\nMy main problem with the movie is the storyline. Some parts were far- fetched like how the parents handled Elsa's powers after the accident. Separating the two sisters and isolating Elsa only caused her powers to get out of hand at times. At least, Anna and Elsa turned out just fine after a decade of barely seeing each other. The addition of Grand Pappie and the other rock trolls was ridiculous. The rock trolls add nothing to the story. Also, they could've explained how to handle Elsa's powers better which would've made things a lot easier for the royal family. I really hated the twist with the movie's villain. It was obvious that it was tacked on last minute.\\n\\nI do like Anna and Elsa a lot. They're both great princesses in their own right. On the other hand, they do make stupid decisions that make no sense. One example is Elsa just running away from her problems and singing about how she doesn't care about what others think and acts like an idiot when Anna comes to see her in the ice castle that she created. Also, Anna stupidly decides to marry a prince that she barely knows. Despite their stupid decisions, I still like the two sisters along with Olaf the snowman.\\n\\nThe movie has beautiful animation like Tangled. It also has some great songs like Do You Want to Build a Snowman, For the First Time in Forever, and of course, Let It Go. Other songs should have been cut out like Fixer Upper because they add nothing to the story. I can't see how Frozen is anything like the movies from the Disney Renaissance era. It's good, but not that good. For a kid like me who grew up during the 1990's, it's hard to top movies like Aladdin, Lion King, and Mulan. Despite its flaws, I will still recommend Frozen to others.\"}\n",

No, not really, but they are catchy and pretty and fit the movie. And the \"In Summer\" song with the snow man in summer is pretty cute, if not a little jarringly placed!

The music is nowhere near that level, and the storytelling is not nearly as sharp. Even suggesting that this is the best *since* The Lion King rings false with me. I have not seen every Disney film of the past twenty years, but offhand I can say that Tangled, Bolt and Meet the Robinsons are all far superior examples well-written stories than Frozen. In my personal opinion, of course.\\n\\nSecond of all, Frozen definitely skews towards the younger crowd, with little to none of the sophisticated touches or wittily mature humor that have come to be somewhat more commonplace in recent animated films. This one is aimed at the pre-teen crowd. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but it is worth noting.\\n\\nThe overall story is an interesting one, but the execution is rather sloppy and the narrative meanders a bit too much. The dialog, in particular, is not a strength. Unlike the best films, in which every line and every scene feels both essential and perfect, Frozen is more of a loose joyride. Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with that approach, but in my personal estimation, it earns lower marks as a storytelling method.\\n\\nThe songs are for the most part unremarkable, and some of the musical sequences suffer from not fully committing to dialog or singing. They just feel hastily-choreographed and not fully thought out. And do not even get me started on the troll song. Yikes.\\n\\nTwo of the songs, \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman\" and especially \"Let it Go,\" do work very well. The latter ties into what is unquestionably the best scene in the film on every level. It provides the one glimpse of true majesty, the sort of quality that would explain all of the extremely positive \"this is the greatest\" reviews that are being posted by others. Unfortunately, the film descends most of the way back into mediocrity after that scene.\\n\\nOn the positive front, however, Frozen offers a fantastic, gorgeous take on the visual elements of winter. Deep blue ice, snowflakes, white mountains contrasting with colored skies. It is an unspeakably lovely display of a subject matter than CGI animation has never (in my experience) turned its energies to before, at least not like this. Of course, it goes without saying that all of the animation in Frozen, characters and landscapes alike, is excellent.\\n\\nFor me, Tangled was much more satisfying than Frozen. I applaud Disney for honing their CGI skills, and for finally adapting The Snow Queen to screen. I just wish that they would have spent more time on the script.\\n\\nWith films like this one, a distinction needs to be made between loving it for the visceral takeaway (\"it was sweet\"/\"it had a great message\"/\"it made me feel good\") and looking at it from a critical standpoint. Now, I understand that one needs to just \"forget about being critical\" and enjoy a film - for me, the best films take care of that themselves. It is the ones, like Frozen, that seem like they clearly could have been much better, that get me thinking about just that.\\n\\nThis film is a fun one for kids, and great to look at for adults, but it is far short of being great, or a masterpiece. More focus on an truly excellent story, and it might have been.'}\n",

I really wasn\\'t a fan of this film because the whole \"teenager on a school trip\" concept was ridiculous, and the script was awful. They tried there utmost to make it funny, but it just didn\\'t work, and Tom Holland\\'s constant whining about how much he wanted to be with his school friends, and trying to get the girl, became tedious after a while. I can\\'t believe that Spider-man went through the whole of Infinity War and Endgame, saving the world with the Avengers, and ended up dodging Nick Fury\\'s calls because he wanted to be with his friends. On top of that, the humongous creatures that were attacking Europe weren\\'t enough for the school to cancel the trip, which was totally unrealistic. The major twist in the film was also written badly, which was a shame because I actually liked Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) before he turned dark. On the plus side, I did like seeing the aftermath of Tony Stark death, and how the so-called \"blip\" affected the world, but with all that in mind, Spider-man still was acting like an immature teenager, even though he was heavily involved in the battle against Thanos. The whole drone concept was also completely ridiculous, and the fact that no one realised that it was all an illusion, blew my mind. Although I found the film disappointing, Tom Holland is a good Spider-man, in terms of his movements and action scenes, but I think it\\'s about time that he took his role as a super-hero seriously. I don\\'t know how close the character is to the comics, so I can\\'t totally blame the director for his vision but I\\'m really getting fed up with his boyish behaviour, especially after Tony Stark took him under his wing. The action scenes made the film watchable, even though they were extremely far-fetched, and the ending left the franchise open for many possibilities, but I still expected more after Endgame. Disappointing!\\n\\nRound-Up: This movie was directed by Jon Watts, who also brought you Cop Car, starring Kevin Bacon, and Spider-Man: Homecoming, which was also disappointing. He\\'s returning to direct another Spider-Man movie, which is due out in July 2021, after Tom Holland saved the film from cancellation by forcing renegotiations with Sony and Disney. It\\'s the 28th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and with other movies being released from the MCU franchise beforehand, the plot of the next Spider-Man is unknown. I hope they show a different side to this character because the gullible Spider-Man concept has been done to death.\\n\\nBudget: $160million Worldwide Gross: $1.13billion\\n\\nGenre: Action, Adventure. Sci-Fi Cast: Tom Holland, Samuel L. Jackson, Jake Gyllenhaal, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau, Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, Tony Revolori, J.K. Simmons, Angourie Rice, Martin Starr, J.B.

It brings us back into this Universe acknowledging - and playing homage to - the previous film - but also points us to the future as we fondly remember, but don\\'t dwell on, the past. This Spidey-film takes the titular web-slinger on a roadtrip to Europe where he teams up with Mysterio to fight the Elementals as Peter Parker grapples with the legacy of Tony Stark and a blossoming relationship with MJ.\\n\\nAnd...it\\'s a darn fine film. Director Jon Watts and writers Chis McKenna and Erik Sommers craft a light, fun action flick that leans heavily on the personality and charm of Peter Parker/Spiderman and this succeeds tremendously thanks to the continued strong performance of Tom Holland. He has grown into this role and has now fully embraced it a makes it his own. This is the 5th film that Holland has played Spiderman and he is fully in control of the character and is a joyous character to watch.\\n\\nAbly joining in is Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio - another hero who just might be another strong mentor-like presence for Parker. A fine actor of interesting dimensions, Gyllenhaal understands the type of film that he is in and adapts his performance (and presence) accordingly. Jacob Batalon returns as Peter\\'s friend Ned, and he is everything we\\'ve come to expect from Ned. The same can be said for Jon Favreau\\'s Happy Hogan and Marisa Tomei\\'s Aunt May - both are welcome, warming, presences that help everyone feel good.\\n\\nThe biggest surprise for me is Zendaya\\'s performance as MJ - I really enjoyed it - and that\\'s a surprise. It is one of those nuanced-type performances (in a Superhero film - of all things) that will make me re-assess my thinking about her as a performer. I thought she was that good.\\n\\nSamuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders reprise their roles as Nick Fury and Maria Hill and they are solid while Martin Starr and J.B. Smoove provide broad comic relief as the two teachers who are chaperones of these high school kids (remember they are high school aged in this film - they\\'ll have to graduate into college for the next one, their age is beginning to show). I\\'ve read/heard some negative comments on how \"out of place\" the 2 teachers were in style to the rest of this film (and the MCU in general) and I couldn\\'t disagree more. I thought they brought just the right size of comedy to what is a light film.\\n\\nAnd, make no mistake, this is a light film (which is why I call it a \"palate cleanser\" after Endgame) and that\\'s just fine. The stakes are an excuse to spend time with this characters - and to dazzle with some interesting special effects that I thought were very well done.\\n\\nIf you\\'re into Spiderman - or the Marvel Cinematic Universe - you\\'ll like this film.\\n\\nLetter Grade: B+\\n\\n7 1/2 stars (out of 10) - and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)'}\n",

Superhero movies have almost always carried a heavy weight of nostalgia, fandom import, and franchise insurance on to their silver screen escapades. And even though the latest web-slinging adventure directly follows one of the most ambitious cinematic projects in history (Avengers: Endgame), it somehow finds a way to shed all that in favor of pure, escapist, one-off fun. With lighthearted soul, a travelogue setting, an endlessly relatable hero and a compassionate but cartoonish villain, Far From Home is a Marvel movie made for the Saturday-morning-cartoon crowd. After the world-altering events of \"the snap\", Peter Parker is trying to get back to some semblance of normalcy, when a high school Eurotrip gets interrupted by multiverse superhero Mysterio and some big elemental bad guys. All the everyday superhero facets are here (funny quips, questions of self-worth, great action sequences), but with the added element of an angsty teenage comedy. How does he tell MJ he likes her? Can he and his bff stay friends while having girlfriends? What kind of fun can they get into in Europe? This seems low stakes, and I suppose it is in comparison to much of the MCU, but that\\'s what makes the story work: we know these characters on a personal level, and we like them for it. Honestly, after the Infinity Saga ended, with all its drama, death and destruction, Far From Home\\'s down-to-earth, low-stakes, neighborhood feel is exactly the comedown we needed. With no overarching plotlines, no big universal threat, and few crossover implications, this manages to be a perfect summer escape.'}\n",

The very first Iron \"Spider\" Man suit he was wearing was the absolute worst and almost turned me off immediately to this movie. Mercifully, they ditched that idea fairly quickly.\\n\\nEveryone has their favorite Bond, Superman, Batman. (Daniel Craig, Christopher Reeve and Michael Keaton, respectfully. Jus sayin\\'.) And my favorite Webslinger is Tobey Maguire, by a landslide. Now, Tom Holland\\'s fine and better than Andrew Garfield - but only in acting, not looks. Garfield definitely looked more like Spidey to me. But, I digress.\\n\\nHolland\\'s okay. No offense to that fine actor, but I don\\'t think anyone, including myself, goes to see a Spider-Man movie because he leads it. Now, that said, having Jacob \"Ned\" Batalon and Tony \"Flash\" Revolori back, plus the additional Remy \"Brad\" Hii, are huge draws for me.\\n\\nI digress, again. \"Far From Home\" is one huge swing above Holland\\'s first Iron Man Jr. movie, \"Homecoming.\" While the first chapter was fine, it was nowhere near as good as the original Maguire trilogy, though oodles better than the Amazing Spider-Man duo.\\n\\nNow, that said, I\\'d rank this 8th big screen Solo Spider-Man movie about half-way down the list with Spider-Man 2, 1 and Into the Spider-Verse edging this out. It\\'s good, but super long. C\\'mon guys...I know you relish in avoiding the editing process, but a solid half-hour could\\'ve been cut from this and made it rank probably higher.\\n\\nPeter Parker & Co (kids from school plus two dimwitted chaperones) are headed to Europe! And as ALL SUPERHERO MOVIE TROPES GO: Parker just wants to be normal and give his \"great responsibilities\" a rest. Also, as always, it\\'s for a love interest. And, as always, danger gets in the way and heroism is needed.\\n\\nA new hero emerges, but anyone who\\'s ever seen a Spidey comic or cartoon before knows where this is going and, despite that, it\\'s pretty well done and I like the arc Parker has to change to advance the story.\\n\\nThe action is pretty darn good, the jokes work about 75% of the time and the chemistry between all the actors on screen: very well done. The score\\'s just okay, never, ever memorable and the enormous tie-ins to Tony Stark (plus Endgame) was annoying to me. No, I\\'m not a fan of the Iron Man Jr./Spider-Man alternative universe. I\\'m a fan of Parker discovering all his powers, weaknesses, abilities, suits and webs on his own. My biggest gripe with \"Homecoming\" was that it was just Iron Man 4 with special guest star: Spider-Man. This one, mercifully, has some less Stark in it, but it does find Parker at bat...alone. Somewhat, but still. The Bat, Baseball Gear, Ball, Training, Funding...all still: Tony.\\n\\nOverall, I liked it a ton, despite its flaws and things that should\\'ve been cut. I didn\\'t, however, like the two post credit scenes. The first: YOU NEED TO SEE, the second - like 14 minutes later!!! egad - you really don\\'t. Sure, it\\'s part of the movie, and does provide information, but it can be skipped until you can see this again at home and can, thankfully, fast-forward those 14 wasted minutes.\\n\\nThis European Vacation is recommended and WAY better than the Griswold one.\\n\\n***\\n\\nFinal thoughts: Back to those post credits. I understand the direction these Avenger-(mostly Tony Stark)-heavy Spider-Man movies are going, but I hated the first post credit scene with the exception of one AWESOME returning character/actor. I know how Iron Man 1 set the tone for the remaining 20+ MCU films, but I sure as heck miss the olden days of Superheroes and their alter-egos.'}\n",

This is briefly touched on when we see Peter and his crew are now in the same class as those who were 5 years behind them having caught on while they have not aged a single day. The movie could've taken a darker turn but this being a summer release and it's protagonist is still in high school, we're treated to seeing Peter needing a vacation and a break from all the superheroing (remember he had to be saved by all the women in Avengers, still one of the coolest sequence in Endgame) and the mourning of Tony Stark's passing. Let the kid be a kid for once I say and let's join him on his (mis)adventures across Europe (cue in heavy sigh of relief heard from New Yorkers.)\\n\\nHaving found a second chance at life, he takes the opportunity to let his feelings known for MJ (short for Michelle Jones and not MJ Parker, seeing how casting a black girl for a mermaid has gotten people throwing a hissy fit) when they get to Paris. He enlists the aide of his reliable sidekick Ned (played perfectly by Jed Batalon) only to end up in one hilarious mishap after another for where would be the fun if everything went smoothly? Tom Holland is charming as Peter Parker and I would like to say he might even be this generation's answer to Michael J. Fox. Speaking of, he will need all the charm he can muster up because we've seen so many incarnations of Spiderman (Tobey Maguire: 3 movies, Andrew Garfield: 2 movies, and we've already seen Tom Holland in 4 movies before we even got to this sequel) and to some, fatigue is starting to set in. Zendaya is great as per usual, and with that face of hers and how confidently in charge she is of her career we should expect more from her in the years to come. I couldn't separate Jake Gyllenhaal from his role as Mysterio, like I think he's too serious of an actor to be here, especially in a movie centered for teens but he put in a good work, something to show his kid in the future that he can be cool too. But taking a quick look at his instagram he seems to have enjoyed his time so yes I still think he's doing it for the nieces, nephews and future kids, and now also so he won't feel left out when friends Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds don their costumes for their holiday photos. Lastly, it's nice to see Marisa Tomei logging in more minutes, and we should see more of her in the 3rd installment after the big reveal in the mid-credits. There's a lot more supporting actors that did well here so much so that I'm starting to doubt whether Tom can carry the movie on his own (Tony Stark in Homecoming, Nick Fury and Happy Hogan here.)\\n\\nJust when I'm about to declare Spiderman as a boring hero (nothing flashy, just spiderwebs and what Aunt May calls the 'Peter tingle'), the fight sequences here makes you reconsider so kudos to the fight scene choreographer. The writer and visual effects people also did good, for I having read a couple of Spiderman titles was thinking how can they make this boring villain interesting, which they did. Also worth commending is how timely it touches on believing what you're seeing and the proliferation of fake news (see mid credits, with a nostalgic cameo.) As Mysterio said in the movie: People... need to believe. And nowadays, they'll believe anything. So don't believe me when I say Marvel has another hit on their hands. Go out and see it.\"}\n",

There are more laughs to be had as the school trip hits Europe, and \"free-and-easy batchelor\" Ned ( Jacob Batalon) forms an unlikely romance with fellow student Betty (Angourie Rice).\\n\\nEven Gyllenhaal infects his role with a \\'wink-at-the-camera\\' nonchalence that is giggle-worthy. \"This is Quentin....\" introduces Peter; \"No.... \" interrupts Gyllenhaal with a \\'Smolder Bravestone\\' eyebrow to camera... \"that\\'s Mysterio!\"\\n\\nThis irreverence extends to the main villain of the piece (who only emerges late in the second reel), revelling in the role with high camp concern for the creases in his cloak!\\n\\nThis is an excellent ensemble cast, brought over nicely from \"Spider-Man - Homecoming\" by the same director and writing team (Jon Watts and Erik Sommers respectively). Each character in the school party is well formed: Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori) for example is desperately video-blogging in an attempt to have \"likes\" fill a personal void (a greeting on arrival at a US airport is both hilarious and heart-breaking).\\n\\nTom Holland is great again in the role. He is surely the definitive Peter Parker. I wonder if he had a terrible cold or hayfever or something during filming, since he seemed to have watering eyes in a lot of his scenes.... even the ones that weren\\'t sad!\\n\\nZendaya - hot property now after \"The Greatest Showman\" - does a marvellous job as MJ. As the incredibly sexy siren in \"Showman\", here she plays the exact opposite: a shy and geeky schoolgirl who you would think about taking for a milk-shake but nothing more.\\n\\nAnd once again, surely shining as a future star in her own right, is Angourie Rice as Betty. She was just sooooo great in \"The Nice Guys\", and here - for me - stole all the scenes she was in.\\n\\nAs always for a Marvel flick there is a finale that gives the numerous digital artists a roof over their heads for another year. But it\\'s all well done.... I had fears on seeing the \"Night Monkey\" outfit in the trailer that we might be heading for another \"Spider-Man 3\", surely the CGI / multi-villain nadir of the series. But no, it\\'s all good. Earlier in the film there is quite a mind-warping sequence that is reminiscent of the \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" of \"Dumbo\"! (Again, those digital artists all needed a new conservatory or two).\\n\\nAre there any \"end credit scenes\" at the end of the film? Yes, actually two crackers. The first features a very welcome cameo return to a well-loved role and provides for a great cliff-hanger ending! And the second - which will probably bamboozle occasional Marvel watchers - made little sense at all yet was good fun!\\n\\nThis is a great summer popcorn movie, enormously entertaining, helped along by a superb soundtrack by Michael Giacchino (if you want to feel some superhero energy for your morning tube ride, listen to his Far from Home Suite Home (LOL) on Youtube). Yes, the movie is a piece of superhero fluff, closer to the \"Ant Man\" end of the dramatic spectrum, but after the \"heavy\" drama of \"Endgame\", it\\'s just what the doctor ordered. Thoroughly recommended.\\n\\n(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann\\'s Movies on the interweb or Facebook. Thanks.)'}\n",

It may not be perfect, but The Avengers lives up to its promise and delivers quite a punch. I feel The Avenger struggles as most superhero movies do with finding a way to naturally introduce its characters in a way that doesn't seem forced or formulaic. They do a decent job for what it is, but there are certain times you will feel the campiness of older works coming on as you view the film, and truly you just have to sit through it to get to the action that eventually will be at hand. Besides that though, there isn't many flaws. The acting is rather good, Samuel L. Jackson may take a line too seriously or too, but it's all in good fun. Again Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a major standout, and I also enjoyed the return of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth Thor- as well as an improved performance by Chris Evans as Captain America and a great performance from replacement Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo. The action scenes are exciting and tense, there is some camera angles here and there that can be a bit annoying, but for the most part it is rather clear and not awfully tedious action- as many films of this type could be. In the end, despite its campiness and formulaic actions- The Avengers is an incredibly fun time. It takes pride in its stories and characters and makes the most out of an experience that could have easily been phoned in. Its a film that will live on for some time, and one i'm rather glad I got to experience first hand.\\n\\nMy Rating: 9.4/10.\"}\n",

The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.\\n\\nRobert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he has to fight Thor that was cool then in the third act he had to do a lot of stuff, did the final stuff to safe the world. He is very much star of the film, that is why he number 1 star of the film he was payed a lot of more money then the other actors did ,but he deserved it he did a good job. Chris Evans as Captain America was spectacular I love his character I love how he defended and safe those people in the restaurant against Loki's army I thought that was descent. He does kick some ass when Thor hits him he uses his shield when SHIELD's ship was attacked he and Iron Man were trying to fix the ship I loved that.\\n\\nMark Ruffalo was okay as The Hulk I thought he was better than Edward Norton's Hulk at least that is my opinion. Chris Hemsworth I liked him as Thor he was great. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was fantastic what does she do? She deals with the Hulk and Hawkeye the evil Hawkeye which I think is great. Jeremy Renner I like him a as an actor he is cool, he is mostly the bad guy in the film till the third act. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. Loki he did fine the actor did fine as the villain I like him and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury did fine.\\n\\nIn the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.\\n\\nThe pacing to me I thought it was little boring and it was too long but the third act was really was fast paced and the movie interested how 6 superheroes become a team who turn in to Avengers I think there was a lot of action scenes in the film that were really well done. I like special effect, I had a lot of fun scenes Hulk punching Thor or punching Loki when he said is emperor. That was fun, the film it self had a lot of action it self's.\\n\\nIt was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues. I have more enjoyed Captain America because he cared more about people and of course Iron Man he saved the world from Loki's invaders. I thought it was an alright and I love it. It is definitely my favorite MARVEL superhero movie.\\n\\nAdmittedly the first half or so isn't nearly as epic as the final 30 minutes. And the plot isn't that original. But I got what I paid for with this flick, Awesome action with Earth's Mightiest Heroes kicking alien ass.\\n\\nThe Avengers in my honest opinion was better than Man of Steel because right next year DC superman movie come out that I have hated it and I wish I could have get the money back. I am going to try and sell the movie out.\\n\\nMarvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon.\\n\\nI have reviewed 2 years the second movie twice and as a MARVEL fan I can say I have enjoyed this movie much more than Avengers: Age of Ultron. I am waiting now on Avengers: Infinity War and of course Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a spin off Captain America: Civil War like I said I have enjoy all three Captain America Films and I enjoy both Avenger films and I love Iron Man and Iron Man Three I am one of the fans that I liked that films. The rating I give is 10/10\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '9/10', 'title': 'Not 100% perfect but still an outstanding film in so many ways', 'movie_id': '0848228', 'author': 'TheLittleSongbird10', 'date': 'August 2014', 'content': \"Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox\"}\n",

It\\'s not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it may just be the best comic book adaption made period! The Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L. Jackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about joining Avengers Initiative\\x85in that short scene, the framework for potentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun! Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) as \"assembled\" by Nick Fury. Whedon\\'s scripts usually include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers. The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life, beginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his charisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark! Chris Evans\\' solidifies himself in the role of Captain America. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth\\'s Asgardian god Thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of the film\\'s most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson\\'s Black Widow is provided a back-story, which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to prove she is much more than just a pretty face; she\\'s as dangerous psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying a beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of screen time was Jeremy Renner\\'s Hawkeye; happily, he\\'s not left by the wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character. Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger Games) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I\\'d like to see more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice to play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking angry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he displays when the opportunity calls for him to \"hulk out\". If any character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for me it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson\\'s Nick Fury is finally more than just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role. Clark Gregg\\'s Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition. The film\\'s main villain is Thor\\'s adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but Hiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go unnoticed, because it\\'s one of the strong points of the film. Loki is not a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious mastermind without being cartoonish. At a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may not have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we\\'re provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without feeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book film, but a story with reason that\\'s backed up with incredible action and humor. Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are short changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work with, and the opportunities don\\'t go to waste. The film\\'s finale provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual with Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence, which provides a surprising reveal. I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it. After viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my expectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to put onto the screen, what I was watching. I\\'m happy that Marvel had the sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and deservedly so; because there\\'s never been another movie made of its caliber. Grade: A+'}\n",

While the MCU had been planned in advance, unlike the comic books it was based upon which had to rely on coordinating the artists, writers, and editors, the films had all that in addition to budgets, casts, and general feasibility with the noted departure of Edward Norton as Bruce Banner following disagreements over 2008\\'s The Incredible Hulk which ended up being downplayed in terms of its significance to the overall universe, and uncertainty that Scarlet Johansson would even return as Black Widow with a back-up script featuring the inclusion of The Wasp briefly considered. However following re-writes by director Joss Whedon that elaborated on Zak Penn\\'s original script, the script and cast was set including a soft relaunch of the Hulk character with Mark Ruffalo stepping in for Norton. Upon release the film garnered the best receives of the series since the original Iron Man and became a massive hit too with a $200 million opening weekend in the United States that carried it to $600 million domestically and $1.5 million worldwide that most likely gave Paramount massive sellers remorse for only taking a little over $100 million for distribution of Avengers and Iron Man 3....whoops. All these years later now free of the buildup and hype that propelled it to blockbuster status, does The Avengers still hold up? In short, yes it does.\\n\\nThe movie does a good job of including and paying off all the characters and plot threads established over the previous films with every character getting their chance to shine even seemingly minor characters like Hawkeye and Black Widow who didn\\'t get to do much in their debuts in Thor and Iron Man 2 respectively, but do feel like they\\'re allowed to make more of an impression this time around and get some solid standout moments despite being alongside their powered colleagues. Robert Downey Jr. Is really good as Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth remains good as Thor, and Chris Evans is still as effortlessly likable as Captain America and his traditional values where he fought more overtly evil antagonists are contrasted well against a world with more shades of grey to it and is probably one of the reasons why Captain America\\'s movies tended to be the best in this franchise. The movie also gives some great moments to its supporting cast including Clark Gregg\\'s welcome return as Agent Coulson, Jeremy Renner and Scarlet Johansson get some fun moments as Hawkeye and Black Widow, and Mark Ruffalo gets a fantastic introduction as Bruce Banner/Hulk with some solid pathos from the character as well as some genuinely amusing humorous moments especially in the climax. Loki is also a solid antagonist who is wonderfully despicable embracing his \"trickster\" persona as someone who has considered every possible angle and wants his adversaries to know it. There is the occasional gaffe in storytelling such as with Loki\\'s \"partners\" purposefully kept off screen for the sake of laying groundwork for more sequels and I wasn\\'t quite sure how Thor found out about the Chitahuri (or even their name for that matter) but these are minor nitpicks in a movie that delivers everywhere it should.\\n\\nThe Avengers is the gold standard for modern \"cinematic universes\" and many have tried to copy its formula to only modest success if at all (I\\'m sure we all remember the Dark Universe...oh wait, no we don\\'t). The Avengers does a good job of balancing many moving parts and characters and feels like a well worth it pay off to the films that preceded it while also laying the groundwork for what\\'s to come.'}\n",

Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen. While the heroes' stand alone films doesn't have that enough action, this movie executes more of their super abilities. It's really fun and exciting. A lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes. This is what all fans and moviegoers want in Avengers. More fighting, more explosions, more smashing, and more fun. In the end, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness. The Avengers is simply marvelous.\\n\\nOur modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense, bland characters, and too long runtime. The runtime here is long but it's necessary. The storytelling is quite simple as it gets. We already knew who these characters are. The best part is when they develop their relationship to each other. This happened mostly in the second act. These scenes are funny and entertaining. It's more entertaining when there's Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show. Of course, he will always be like this. His chemistry with Bruce Banner is wonderful. Two geniuses working together. Other than that, the rest of the performances were also good. Chris Hemsworth is just mighty enough as Thor and Chris Evans is cool enough as Captain America. Scarlett Johansson is probably the weak link here. She's still sexy though.\\n\\nMaybe the only problem here is the secondary villains. They are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for Hulk to smash them. But it doesn't matter because there's Loki stealing all of his scenes once again. Tom Hiddleston is simply fantastic as Loki. The action is pretty awesome. It's suppose to be awesome! The Hulk nails it in these scenes. It's exciting to see him smash stuff with glory. While there's Iron Man flying, Thor wielding his hammer, Captain America throwing his shield, and Hawkeye shooting with his archer. More explosions, just what everyone wants. It's fantastically cool and fun.\\n\\nThere are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions. The film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them. It's a rare kind of blockbuster these days. It has clever humor, awesome action, and really fun characters. It makes the Fans and Moviegoers happy and amazed. This is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch. This film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer. Though, I still think the first Iron Man movie is the best of this set, but still, this is a big, fun experience you will have in the big screen.\"}\n",

Joss \"Firefly\" Whedon was the director and co-writer on this highly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero team co-created by Stan Lee (who also appears in a very small cameo, like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a hand in creating) and the late Jack Kirby. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the six misfits chosen by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) to defeat the traitorous Asgardian misfit Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army from laying waste to New York City. And of course, six characters usually accustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come together as a team to save the world. What gets \"The Avengers\" many points is that beside its big action sequences, fights and special effects, we never really lose sight of the characters (who are usually relegated to the background in a movie like this) and who they are. I liked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual characters so that we get to know them all over again - even though they\\'ve all already appeared in previous superhero films. It\\'s all big superhero fun, with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor that manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this thing with an open mind. Sit back and enjoy!\\n\\n10/10\\n\\nP.S.: What happened to Dr. Henry \"Hank\" Pym/Giant-Man and Janet van Dyne/The Wasp?

It took some time to get everyone on the same page, but in the end, their shared goal inspired them to work together as a team, which is why I admired how the Avengers came together.

I mean, come on, a bunch of superheroes gathering and fighting evil, that is just priceless. And not any superheroes but the most well-known and well-loved. The movie has some of the best actors in Hollywood portraying some of the best superheroes to have ever been created. This movie has loads of Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, and, needless to say, Hulk Smash! They were all portrayed on screen brilliantly and I give thanks to the actor for making them feel awesome, cool, and really, really fun. I live in Australia and we get an earlier viewing of the film but for you Americans, this wait is is worth it. When the movie was over, most of the cinema clapped - this was the first time I had ever seen this ever at the movies. Even though it was 12 in the morning, the whole cinema was packed and all of them came out of the cinema satisfied and were glad they paid the $13 to watch it.\\n\\nThe plot of the movie is straightforward but done magnificently. Loki, previously seen in Thor, wants to wreak havoc on Earth by letting a group of aliens enter Earth through a portal. It's up to the Avengers to stop him but first they have to solve the rivalries and bitterness between them. The fight scenes between the superheroes are just f*cking AWESOME! I was so excited to see Thor and Iron Man battle it out - that scene was just plain epic.\\n\\nThe music and soundtrack in the movie was good and it did a nice job of alleviating the action, and trust me there is a LOT of action. The visual effects are also fantastic, one of the best I have ever seen in a film, and they will leave you in awe. Hulk, along with Iron Man, do a good job of adding humour into the film and ALL of the scenes with the Hulk left everyone at the cinemas laughing. It is pretty obvious that his squad mates think highly of him as seen in the scene where Stark and Loki have a confrontation ('We have an Army' , 'We have a Hulk'). That scene was what did it for me.\\n\\nIf you guys are in doubt as to see this then let me assure you that you are gonna get the bang for your buck that you deserve. So far, it is one of the best superhero film made but of all time? Not really sure, guess we have to wait for TDKR to come out. 10/10 - Perfect!\\n\\n'Over and Out.' 25 April 2012\"}\n",

We have been waiting for this from years. To understand the Avenger's movie it's really important that you've seen all previous Ironman, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America's movies. As the avenger's give time to build characterizations for their heroes so getting into the avengers empty headed about hero's history will be foolish. The Avenger's brings back our beloved Marvel's heroes Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury. Each hero's journey starts from where it ended in their respective movies. Now, The Avenger's stands strong in every department, from direction, production and performances. It won't be wrong to say that it brings out the best out of all the heroes. The humor, action and graphics are far brilliant than all the previous Marvel movies combined. The credit goes to generous brain of Joss Whedon. He brings out something very special out of each superhero. The interaction between all superheroes is something we don't see often, they tease, make fun and even fight with each other. Robert Downey Jr. (Ironman) is great as always. He brings his charming personality and wicked humor into his character which made him the superstar of today. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is truly a god of thunder. His entry is as Big as Thor's entry should be, it makes you jump of your seat and cheer for him. Chris Evens (Captain America) is indeed the ultimate American Hero, he got the charm and personality of a true America hero. Some of the most standout moments in the movie belong to Mark Ruffalo (The Incredible Hulk). For the first time we see some humor in the actions of Hulk, he is just not a fury green monster this time around. besides Hulk, the biggest surprise is Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), we have seen the part of her in Ironman movie but this time around we completely understand the strength and wickedness of Black Widow. She is absolutely stunning and fantastic. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is good and I hope to see him someday with Black Widow. They had this amazing chemistry which requires further attention. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Samuel L. Jackson the S.H.E.I.L.D are fun to watch. Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is superb, he was the ultimate villain and considering his brilliant performance in Thor, he has out done himself again. Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) appearance is appreciated and I would have loved to see Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) in it too. On the whole, The Avengers is the finest brilliant superhero movie of all time, it's filled with great performance, humor, action, graphics and brilliant direction. Highly recommended in 3D.\"}\n",

This was an unusual screening as movies of this caliber are not screened some three weeks before it\\'s release date. Just minutes before the movie started, we were all surprised when writer/director Joss Whedon walked in with Kevin Feige to introduced their little \"Justice League\" movie. Not only did we all laugh, but some booed. lol. If that wasn\\'t enough of a surprise, the soft spoken Whedon introduced on stage Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) and Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill). Wow is she stunning in person! The audience gave them all a standing ovation with deafening cheers! (This explained why the secret service like security were searching, wanding everyone. No cameras, cell phones, nothing was allowed in.) What a nice surprise for an early Saturday morning screening.\\n\\nI\\'ve never read comic books. This is a comic book movie. It was made for hardcore fans of comics, and I appreciate the care Joss Whedon gives to this movie. It was very entertaining to see Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury all interact with one another.\\n\\nCapt. Steve Rogers was fighting in WWII just yesterday. Having been recently awoken from his frozen sleep, he struggles to fit in our modern world with all this technology around us. The God of Thunder, Thor, is not from this world (realm) and doesn\\'t understand modern technology on Earth as well. Dr. Bruce Banner has been on the run from the government, practicing medicine in third world countries. He hasn\\'t been the Hulk in two years (What\\'s his secret? ;). Tony Stark is still the same, playing with this high tech toys and inventing new technology. So how do you get them all to interact and play well together? Well, Director Joss Whedon is the secret to making it all work.\\n\\nThe highlight of the film for me is how Joss Whedon has all these characters interact. Deep character development was not needed for this film. (That is what the respective movies are for: Thor, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger) He does a great job of not forcing dialogue, and the interaction of the characters is much more organic than I would have ever anticipated. That is where Whedon deserves the most credit. He took what appears to be a very silly premise, with silly looking characters and made it completely work. Seeing as the Avengers comics date back to the 1960s, you can tell he not only did his homework, but he really cares deeply for the material, and his passion definitely shows on- screen.\\n\\nThe movie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. A couple of dialogue lines seemed off, but once you remember who the character is, and why they talk the way they do (think of where they come from), it all makes sense. Each respective character is true and honest to itself. Each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. It is by far the best Marvel movie to date.\\n\\nSo who was my personal favorite character from the movie? Dr. Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo) of course! He is by far the BEST Bruce Banner/Hulk since Bill Bixby. His intelligence (genius) is unparalleled (greater than Tony Stark\\'s) and his compassion for human lives is what drives the good side of his character. As a kid growing up, he was my favorite Marvel super hero. I enjoyed watching Bill Bixby play medical doctor/physicist Dr. David Banner on television. I\\'d watch, terrified with my hands up to my face, as he transformed into the raging green hulk. Yet i was so fascinated with him being a scientist, helping those in need. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didn\\'t know what to think of it. I knew that he\\'s a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner. Or at least, i vote for him to reprise his role in any sequel. He was a natural fit for this role.\\n\\nOverall, the best thing about these characters is that they are not silly twenty-something terrible actors who were chosen for on-screen eye candy. They all do a fine job of bringing these characters to life and their chemistry together works great. Assembled, they are unstoppable. When i heard an Avengers movie was rumored to be in the works, i was ecstatic. The day has finally come. Go see it. Thrice. 10/10 Stars.'}\n",

Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing!

I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.\\n\\nI highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen.

James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless.\\n25 out of 27 found this helpful.

      "As perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get\n",
      "{'ratings': '10/10', 'title': \"As perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get\", 'movie_id': '0120338', 'author': 'InaneSwine18', 'date': 'February 2016', 'content': '\"Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one.\" It\\'s time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.\\n\\nFirst of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film\\'s set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I\\'ve seen.\\n\\nHowever, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it\\'s intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we\\'re watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose\\'s fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.\\n\\nSo aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it\\'s ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It\\'s called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.\\n\\nTitanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It\\'s a romance; it\\'s a disaster movie; it\\'s an action film; it\\'s got a sense of humour and wit; it\\'s a period drama; it\\'s a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you\\'re ever likely to get.'}\n",

But, no matter if you like them or not, there\\'s no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn\\'t exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron\\'s other huge success, \"Avatar\". Well worth seeing once.\\n50 out of 64 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.\\n\\nI caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either. The anxiety level increased as I began to wake up and I got mad at myself for watching the movie right before going to bed!\\n\\nMy thoughts go out to those souls who perished on the Titanic and I hope beyond hope that there is a better place they went to.\"}\n",

It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.\\n\\nIn hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.\\n\\nMy advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'Titanic sucks', is to give it a chance. You're sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well.\"}\n",

The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.

I am a huge fan of the series and was really looking forward to this after hearing this is the best Bond movie yet.

Knowing that they were re-booting the series I was lenient and with this one the re-boot is complete. This had much more of a feel of a classic Bond movie and by the end I was excited to see the next one. I got chills watching a few times and especially at the end. This had possibly the best opening and ending to a Bond movie ever. I could go on and on about this but I will just say if you love Bond you will love this, if you have never seen one then this one will make you a fan.

Skyfall takes a darker approach as we've seen with the past couple films and it's very character driven, yet Sam Mendes and the screenwriters still provide a massive injection of fun. Like most Bond films, Skyfall starts with an incredible chase sequence in Istanbul and continues strongly from then on, including a very stylish silhouette fight in Shanghai. The action scenes sequences were pristinely shot and practical effects were at the forefront.\\n\\nA challenge for the Bond series has always been real-world relevance. The series has faced down all challenges, from the end of the Cold War to the War on Terror. Skyfall tackles the changing nature of espionage. MI6 is no longer the shadowy organisation that the British government denied existed; it has to face the realities of the 24-hour media age we live in and the democratic accountability that incurs.\\n\\nThe nature of the threats have changed, Bond faces a cyber-terrorist and along with the new Q, both could cause more damage than Bond can. In the real world, we have seen what Anonymous is capable of and seen how the Stuxnet worm affected the Iranian nuclear program. But there is always a need for people in the field to investigate. As M says, she is scared of this new world because many of the West's enemies are now faceless and nationless, and this element can work in the series' favour. Versatility has always been a Bond hallmark, which is why it is so enduring.\\n\\nSkyfall also goes full circle for Bond, as the filmmakers reintroduce popular characters, gadgets and humour. In Casino Royale, Bond is a young man who is bold, arrogant and reckless but can get the job done; in Skyfall, Craig is playing an older Bond who is both physically and emotionally vulnerable.\\n\\nThe idea of an older Bond was briefly touched on in the unofficial film Never Say Never Again, but that was more to accommodate a 52-year-old Sean Connery being in the role. In Skyfall there is actual thematic reasons behind it. Craig gives another excellent performance, cementing his reputation as both a great actor and a great Bond, and the script treats him more as a character than an archetype. Along with M's character arch, the film tackles a theme of facing the past so it can be cleansed.\\n\\nThe casting of Javier Bardem was a coup for the series and we as Bond fans are rewarded with a great villain. Bardem makes out Raoul Silva to be a man with seemingly camp mannerisms, but the master planner has a very sinister delivery. He has a complex, tragic background but he is not like other Bond villains looking for control, world domination, money or even self-preservation: he simply wants revenge.\\n\\nSkyfall is a great milestone to celebrate Bond's 50th birthday on film, and the Easter eggs for fans aren't overbearing, but rather nice touches. The last anniversary Bond film, Die Another Day, was a disaster and regarded as one of the worst Bond films. It felt like it had to keep referencing the previous films. Skyfall features a few major references to previous Bond films: Bond getting injured (The World is Not Enough), Bond faking his death (You Only Live Twice), the gun that can only work with Bond's palm print (Licence to Kill) and a similar villain to the one in Goldeneye. But these are references you would want to find, not being forced upon you.\\n\\nSkyfall felt very much like end of one chapter and the start of a new one. Mendes and the writers were able to reintroduce many tropes of the Bond series and still give them a modern and believable twist. For a film that has a 143-minute running time (the second longest Bond film), Skyfall never felt like it dragged and it was an exciting, entertaining film.\\n\\nPlease visit www.entertainmentfuse.com\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '9/10', 'title': 'How safe do you feel?', 'movie_id': '1074638', 'author': 'hitchcockthelegend5', 'date': 'December 2012', 'content': \"Bond 23 and 007 has to literally come back from the dead when a stolen hard-drive makes M (Dench) look bad at a time when a face from her past comes homing into blood thirsty view.\\n\\nThere is one sure fire fact in cinema that nobody can dispute, that of there never ever being a James Bond film that all Bondphiles will agree on. From each corner of the spectrum will come arguments that said Bond film is not gritty enough, not fun enough, not enough sex, not enough action, not enough fantastical stunts and etc etc etc. Well that's fine of course, we all have our peccadilloes we prefer in our Bond movies, but we do live in different times now, the world has changed, and so has Bond. You may not get the ultimate Bond you want, but this is a 21st Century Bond and a new era of 007 is upon us, something which makes Skyfall even the more bolder and braver because it marks the 50th anniversary by blending the old with the new and mostly achieving brilliant results.\\n\\nSkyfall allows us to bathe in nostalgia whilst also forcing us to re- evaluate just where we are at in terms of our beloved super secret agent. One of the great things about this Bond is that there is a bubbling under current of time's importance delicately perched on each side of James Bond's shoulders. Is he (and M etc) outdated? Or is the future still in need of such operatives/organisations? Director Mendes and his team don't take any of the easy options that were clearly available to them to answer the question, they instead build a film around Bond and M as characters, embrace the traditions of the series and hit us hard in head and heart.\\n\\nThe plot of Skyfall as written is simple, absolutely nailed on it is straight and true to Hollywood conventions, but what fills out the simple plot is a series of Bondian delights, thrills spills and emotionally splintered kills. The stunning pre-credits sequence sees Bond traverse the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle and then fight on top of a speeding train. Only to then find himself expendable. Which leads to Daniel Kleinman's title credits sequence that is filled with ominous portents of death and blood, in turn backed by the wonderfully Bondian of old title song warbled by Adele. It's clear at this point that this Bond movie is nodding to traditional values whilst promising to deliver some emotional pain. And so it proves.\\n\\nA washed up Bond enters the fray, and he convinces, he's dishevelled, unshaven and unfit, but he's still a tough bastard who can drink hard and stare a scorpion down. He'll be back soon, we know this, and he will be in wonderful physical shape, and loyal to his surrogate mother for sure. Ah, but there's the adversary on the scene now, a villain to finally give Craig's Bond something to fret about. It's Javier Bardem's (perfect) Silva, a cyber terrorist with a shock of blonde hair, a nasty dental trick and a devilish sexiness that unnerves during an interrogation scene; to which Bond cheekily opens up some wink wink possibilities. There is other sexual tension in the film as well, not just a steamy shower scene, but the ongoing banter with Naomie Harris' (excellent) Eve that positively fizzes with smirking innuendo.\\n\\nBut ultimately this comes down to the love between a man and a woman, the kind that is so different to the type that has so often underpinned a Bond movie. Bond will kill or be killed for M, and how marvellous to see a director really able to give Judi Dench the direction she so deserves, and Bond, in Craig's magnetic and gritty hands, responds in kind to deliver a last half hour as good as any in the 50 years of Bond on film. As we know, all turf is Bond's turf, but this time it really is HIS turf, and as a little back story comes seeping out, Bond gets to exorcise some demons whilst kicking considerable ass. Get ready Bondphiles, this has the emotional wallop only seen in the best Bond movies of old.\\n\\nAll the Bondian trappings are still here, exotic locales, gorgeous women, speeding vehicles, fights, stupendous stunts, bizarre lairs and balls out machismo. It's also funny! I myself commented when reviewing Quantum of Solace that it was pretty ace as an action film, but for many it's not Bondian enough, and the truth of the matter is Bond still needs to have a degree of fun, no matter how grim and gritty the story line is. Thankfully Skyfall is often a blast, with Craig (surely convincing even the most stubborn of dissenters how good a Bond he is) having the confidence and skill to lace his Bond's macho broody instinct with a desert dry wit and shrug of the shoulders nonchalance. Other side of the camera the tech credits are high, with Deakins proving to be one of the aces in the pack. His capturing of vistas, be it a neon city scape or a mountainous valley, are eye delights, his colour tones are beautiful, I promise you, nobody these days does golden browns like Deakins.\\n\\nIt's not the masterpiece that I or gazillions of others hoped for, and it does have flaws (new Q a bit too geeky safe, finale lacks a substantial battle with the villain) and it remains simple in plot, but it's Bond's birthday and the birthday boy has been done proud by the makers. It's a new era Bond for sure, but that most definitely isn't a bad thing, it knows its past and it now knows its future, and without doubt we all still know the name. 9/10\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '8/10', 'title': 'A Bond for a new era', 'movie_id': '1074638', 'author': 'FSfilmblog2', 'date': 'February 2013', 'content': \"A James Bond film made for the modern era, you'd be hard pressed to find any other film series able to stand the test of time and still feel relevant. When it looks like it's lagging behind the competition of the other spy action thrillers, the makers have taken note and re-invented the mould, making it more real and exciting.\\n\\nTo me, Bond had too much of a rigid formula, the cars, the chases, the girls, the gadgets, the megalomaniac villain's and the spectacular set pieces/stunts. After a while though, the older films seem to suffer from a sense of deja vu. It's a case of been there, done that. The structure of the films have become stale and repetitive. Same plot about a group of criminals/organisation hell bent on world domination/destruction, with a beautiful bond girl in tow, Bond and or Bond girl gets capture, ridiculous car chase or stunts with a million of cheesy one liners. Frankly, I had pretty much given up on the Bond films. They have become predictable and tedious with only the change of location to give the film any sort of distinction.\\n\\nThe plot of Skyfall is unlike previous Bond films, starts with the routine chase resulting in Bond being shot and wounded, believed to be dead by MI6. When an attack on MI6 headquarters manifest through a cyber attack and a bombing at the headquarters, Bond returns to uncover who is behind the assault. Struggling from his gun shot wound, Bond has to prove his fitness mentally and physically through some rigorous tests. Sent back into action without being fully fit, Bond embarks on the mission to expose the mastermind. What Bond discovers is a villain who happens to be ex-agent who has a vendetta against M and will stop at nothing to kill her.\\n\\nFirst thing you'll notice is the lack of gadgets and the usually bond girl (there is one of sorts but you'll understand when you watch it). Also with a villain who is suave yet as equally menacing as Hannibal Lector, we have a loose cannon who isn't after the world but revenge. It's spy vs spy and the story is more of a evolution of the characters that inhabit the world of Bond. Nods to older Bond films crop up from dialogue, props and even the classic Austin Martin car makes an appearance. It's a homage as well as a resurrection of well known characters.\\n\\nWhat we are given here is a Bond with more layers to him and more emotions. Daniel Craig has moulded a Bond who is more relateable. Signs of physical and emotional weakness shows us a Bond who is no longer a super spy with little or no vulnerability. Other characters are given more screen time and provide an emotion gravitas (We are also introduced to Q, a young model who is still wet behind the ears).\\n\\nIn the hands of Sam Mendes and Director of photography Roger Deakins, there has never been a more beautiful shot Bond film. During Bond's fight with a criminal minion we see only their silhouettes, but the eye is drawn to the beauty of the neon Shanghai backdrop. The reserve can be said for the grime, dour and rainy streets of London which captures our the United Kingdom perfectly.\\n\\nIt's a satisfying and enjoyable film, with plenty of action and a surprising emotional core to the narrative. A great development in characters with seeds being sown to allow for a more relateable and mature story telling and for future characters to come to the fore. Skyfall has made me fall in love with Bond films again so here's hoping there's no more rigid formula and routine mundane narratives of past.\"}\n",

James Bond is accidentally shot by his partner Eve (Naomie Harris) and believed to be dead. Back in London, M (Judi Dench) finds her position threatened by Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), who urges her to retire in the aftermath of Istanbul. When the MI6 headquarters are bombed following a threatening cyber-message to M, Bond returns, facing questions about his mental state and his physical ability. But when Patrice is tracked down, an assassination leads Bond to a casino in Macao, owned by cyber- terrorist Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former colleague of M's. If I can say off the bat, I've always been in favour of this re- invention of Bond. As the 'old' Bond films were progressing, they were becoming gradually more ridiculous and fantasy-laden, leading to the inexplicable invisible car in Pierce Brosnan's last film as Bond, Die Another Day (2002). The films seemed to be losing sight of Ian Fleming's source novels, and although they remained commercial hits, Brosnan's outings (with the exception of GoldenEye (1995) were becoming increasingly dire. Casino Royale set the tone early with a moody black- and-white sequence that gave birth to Daniel Craig's colder, brutal Bond, less concerned with how his Martini's were made than going to extreme (and illegal) lengths to bring down his target(s). Royale's reinvention showed a darker side to the beloved character, yet staying with tradition, still kept him at an emotional distance. Director Sam Mendes made the bold decision to reveal more about Bond's past and childhood, risking fanboy wrath and damaging Bond's almost mythical characterisations. The main crux of the film focuses on his relationship with M, a stern authoritarian that risks career and her own soul in putting national safety and the success of a mission above the lives of her agents. Bond, being a willing soldier, follows M blindly, and when Silva announces his intention to enact revenge on M for a former betrayal, Bond takes M to his childhood home, Skyfall. Bond facing his childhood allows time to develop on Bond's tormented psyche, but it all seems quite out of place. One of the most intriguing things about Bond is his almost suicidal willingness to risk all for his job due to his almost complete lack of emotion, but Skyfall is unable to make any grand revelations so it all comes to nothing more than a distraction. (Saying that, the only previous Bond film to try and engage Bond emotionally led to one of the most devastatingly cold climaxes in the series' history in the underrated On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969)). As well as the Bourne series, it seems that Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy (2005-2012) is a major influence on this film in particular. Mendes delves deeper into the workings and hierarchy of MI6, rather than just a boss sat behind a desk, and adds a modern, more 'real' bad guy in Silva to the mix (even stealing the Joker's voluntary arrest in The Dark Knight (2008)). Silva is a technical genius, able to hack MI6's database with relative ease, and also proving himself more resourceful and intelligent than Bond and M realise. Bardem is wonderful in the role (as you would expect), but sadly his character is not. Labelling him simply as a cyber virtuoso seems like a very lazy way to allow Silva to repeatedly outwit MI6 and their own technical marvel Q (Ben Whishaw) to the point where you wonder if Britain's finest could really be so stupid. The film is therefore full of plot-holes and distracting MacGuffin's that stretches out the running time to more than it really needs to be. Skyfall also asks a lot of the audience, especially when it comes to suspending their belief. Before the frankly bizarre opening sequence appears and we are treated to Adele's drab title song, we witness an already wounded Bond get shot with a rifle and fall over 300 feet from the Varda Viaduct into water, only to emerge alive and romancing a mystery woman. No explanation is given as to how he manages to survive the ordeal, and given the revelations about Bond's diminishing physical prowess, it seems rather insulting. As questions are raised by his superiors over Bond's ability to his job given his age (it must be the grey in his stubble), Bond is put through various tests in which he struggles with, yet half way through the film, this seems to be simply put aside as he competently shoots and fights his way through various bad guys. Again, no real explanation given. Like I stated before, the most suitable word to describe this film would be underwhelming, especially with the critical adoration that the film was lavished with. The action scenes are dull, with nothing matching the free-jumping opening of Royale. They are also quite strange - was anyone expecting a henchman to be eaten by a CGI Komodo dragon? How about death by underwater funky chicken? It all leads to a very unsatisfying climax at Skyfall, where a simple shoot-out and foot chase fail to justify a 2 hour-plus build-up. It feels like the entire film is building up to an explosive climax that never comes. I found the whole experiencing really quite baffling, with the attempts to mix the old with the new Bond never really convincing or flowing. The film is competently directed by Mendes however, and everything looks suitably crisp and clean. What direction all of this means for Bond, I don't know, but given the film is currently the 14th highest-grossing film of all time, and the film somehow being lauded by critics and audiences alike, it won't be too long until Craig dons the suit once again.\"}\n",

It is an entirely different matter to do so merely because you can, to show off your own power, and to leave the genre in tatters. Sam Mendes is incapable of making a film that is not dazzling to the eye. He is a visual artist of the highest calibre and possibly one of the greatest directors living today. Similarly the lead actors are incapable of delivering a performance that is less than stellar given the scripts they are handed. But the praise ends there. This is not a Bond film. This is an anti-Bond film. Notice kind reader that every task Bond is handed in the script ends in failure. Don't shoot the messenger, just watch the film. Notice that at some point Mendes became momentarily self-aware of what he was doing by bringing, out of nowhere, using the magic of film, the Aston Martin DB7 from a half-century ago, fully fuelled and ready to go, with the old Bond theme for accompaniment. But he just couldn't go through with it. The moment (the self-aware moment) passed and he went back to Plan A, the Anti-Bond film, and, in one of the most gratuitous but Freudian moments ever seen, blew the car to bits. Just like he blew the Bond formula to bits. I know what you are thinking. You thinking that an artist has license to do all this if the end result is entertaining and satisfying. True. But this film is as satisfying to the viewer as a car wreck. Visuals aside, it is hollow and leave a strange taste in the palate. Shame.\"}\n",

The story is superbly put together and has some interesting twists, the action is well done and contains none of the shaky cam which plagued the last film. The actors all do a great job. Some might still be put off by Daniel Craig's rough version of Bond, but I like it and he even has a few good old fashioned one-liners here. I wasn't sure about Javier Bardem as the villain at first. I thought he was a tad too flamboyant but eventually he grew on me, plus he had a very interesting backstory and as you might have guessed already, Judi Dench is fantastic as usual as M and she even has more to do in the story this time arround. This is not a completely formulaic Bond movie. Craig's bond is still more emotional than Connery or Moore ever were and for the first time we get some relatively detailed descriptions of his childhood. And something happens to Bond in the start of the movie that affects him for the rest of the film. But despite all that there are tons of James Bond trademarks like the martini, the introduction and even Q. Some might not like this new very young version of Q but I found him to be funny and very likable. They will never top Desmond Llewelyn's original performance, and instead of making a cheap Llewelyn clone, they make a completely different character which I think is the only right thing to do.

I must say that I stayed pretty interest throughout, but at times I began to look at my watch, wanting to cut to the chase. I like Daniel Craig.

And to much delight, Skyfall is no cash-in...this is a full fledged, action packed, and thoroughly conclusive Bond experience like no Bond film before it.\\n\\nDaniel Craig returns as the stoic James Bond, but this time he is a more vulnerable James Bond than before. The story takes Bond to and company to very interesting places, and the set pieces that follow are incredibly memorable (partly because of the superb cinematography). The finale is especially incredible; it oozes style. Judi Dench is as classic as ever, Ralph Fiennes is excellent, and Javier Bardem is an incredibly complex and sinister: he is equal parts flamboyant and insane. The only weak link here is Naomie Harris. Her introduction is far too brief to get the time to like the character, and her humor is pretty bad. She becomes better as the film moves along, but nothing to the level of past Bond girls.\\n\\nThe action scenes are incredibly well shot and feature some of the best choreography since the Bourne trilogy.

If you have been in love with Bond series as long as I have, ever since childhood, you'll be giddy in your seat!\\n\\nThe soundtrack is also really great, and the new music added fits the mood well.

All of these are little things, but keep this movie from being perfect. That being said, these things won't hurt the experience for all, and they do little to mar the overall experience.\\n\\nSumming up my feelings for Bond's latest is simple: Skyfall is such a good film. Aside from a few nagging little issues, Skyfall couldn't be better. It's filled with memorable action scenes, great characters, impressive cinematography and an unforgettable finale. It carries that same level of cheesiness that Bond films are well known for, and that same brand of humor is back. It's classic Bond in a new era, directed with expertise and style.\\n\\nBond's latest mission is a success.\\n\\n4.5/5 - Fantastic, a must see.\"}\n",

It strayed away from the storyline of the previous two films and I couldn\\'t have been happier after the mediocrity of Quantum of Solace. This film has all the constituents from the Bond films that have preceded it. Big explosions, ridiculous stunts that not a single person in the history of humanity can survive, and let\\'s not forget to mention the beautiful women that would make both genders stop and stare. So what does Skyfall have that the other Bond films don\\'t? For the first time, we get a glimpse into our mysterious hero\\'s dark past. Where he came from and what made him the person he is today.\\n\\nAlthough I\\'ve always been the one to say that Sean Connery is the greatest Bond ever, I can now confess that Daniel Craig now holds that honor. Sean plays the comedic, smooth, and witty Bond to perfection while Daniel plays the mysterious, dark, and lonesome secret agent flawlessly. I will always choose a darker portrayal over a comedic one because it takes a certain mindset to depict someone of that nature. One of my favorite scenes is where Bond is sitting in a bar drinking alone. I don\\'t care who you are or what your background is, if you are drinking by yourself in a bar, then you have issues that are haunting you. Whether you can admit it or not, you are in a dark place and that is exactly where this Daniel Craig portrayed Bond is. And I love it.\\n\\nAside from Daniel Craig, you have a cast that includes some of the finest actors that have ever graced the big screen. Javier Bardem plays a blood thirsty ex-MI6 agent out for revenge. His performance is equally as creepy and twisted as his portrayal of Anton Chigurh in \"No Country for Old Men\" and it is an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Judi Dench reprises her role as M and Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney give important and memorable roles which I won\\'t go further into detail about. Also two prominent figures from James bond history find their way back into the story line. Sam Mendes shows why he was the right choice to direct a film of this magnitude and along with the contribution of Oscar Nominee John Logan, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade come up with a memorable narrative after the disappointment of their last collaborating effort, Quantum of Solace.\\n\\nI look forward to what the future has in store for everyone\\'s favorite spy. If Skyfall is a sign of things to come, then I will remain incredibly optimistic about the future.'}\n",

The story revolves around a computer drive, with a list of British secret agents on it, falling in to the wrong hands. The movie is masterfully directed by Mendes and features more than a handful of spectacular action scenes that Bond films are loved for. One of the better films of the series.\\n\\nThe movie opens with Bond and another MI6 agent, named Eve (Naomie Harris), in Turkey in hot pursuit of the mercenary, Patrice (Ola Rapace), who stole the list of undercover NATO agents. Patrice escapes and Bond is believed to be killed. The MI6 commander, M (Dench), is being pressured to retire because of the incident when MI6 is hacked and eight agents are killed. Bond learns of the attack and returns to London, after letting everyone think he was dead for months, and is returned to active duty despite failing his aptitude tests (which M keeps secret, even from Bond). Bond then teams with Eve once again to find out who's responsible for the attack on MI6, as more agents are killed, and tracks the culprit to an island in China.\\n\\nI've always found good Bond films to have great elaborate action scenes but to be light on pacing and excitement in between. This film is actually much faster paced than most others in the series. It's really exciting and involving all the way up to the last 40 minutes when it seems to drag a little and go on for too long. It appears to climax at about an hour and forty minutes but then unexpectedly takes another turn and continues on (somewhat needlessly) for another 40 minutes. The ending is still action packed and somewhat exciting but by the time it gets there it's ran a little low on steam. This is a flaw in my opinion but not a great one. It's still better than most other Bond films and Craig and Dench are outstanding in it once again (Bardem is also an excellent bad guy). The script is routine but a little more emotionally involving than usual, especially involving M's character, and Mendes is perfectly apt at directing a Bond film. It's a nice 50th anniversary piece, for the series, and fans will love it.\\n\\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM\"}\n",

It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, I\\'m a woman in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\\n3,645 out of 5,083 found this helpful.

But as the day went on I kind had that \"Ok, that kebab probably wasn\\'t a good idea.\"\\n\\nThe film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.\\n\\nWhen we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she\\'s not as perfect as she\\'s been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he\\'s ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.\\n\\nI don\\'t know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That\\'s a lot of pressure for one film, I know.\\n\\nHowever... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.\\n\\nMaybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it\\'s just kind of... yuck.\\n\\nBarbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.\\n\\nIf you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don\\'t take this film too seriously, then maybe you\\'ll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.\\n\\nBut if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?'}\n",

A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...\\n\\nThe past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.\\n\\nTo me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.\\n\\nAnd the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.\\n\\nTo me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.\\n\\nIt seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to...

Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.\\n\\nOn the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.\\n\\nAvengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.\\n\\nOf course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.\\n\\nLastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10\"}\n",

It\\'s hard to see how they\\'ll be able to top this one.\\n\\nIt\\'s surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I\\'ve laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok).

I'll assume that 'part 3' (not including the Avengers) won't be people's first helping of Iron Man lore and they'll probably have a shrewd idea of what to expect from the previous episodes.\\n\\nHowever, the film-makers have decided to go in a slightly different direction with this one. I can see their point. It may have felt a bit 'samey' to have yet another villain wearing a suit of armour to battle our sarcastic hero Tony Stark, so they decided to downplay the suits of armour for the better part of the movie. Instead they focused more on 'the man' himself, utilising his deductive powers, rather than just blasting baddies with his lasers.\\n\\nAnd, to be blunt, while some people loved it, others hated it. So if you're looking for yet another superhero movies with larger than life baddies and plenty of high-tech, suit-wearing, destructive action, you may feel a little cheated. There is plenty of action (and a suitably explosive climax), but a lot of it involves more hand to hand fighting from Stark.\\n\\nPersonally, I thought it was quite a refreshing turn for a superhero film. Tony Stark always has been and always will be, Iron Man. If I just want to see him in the suit itself, I have parts 1 and 2 to watch. Nice to see something different. Roll on part 4 (and the Avengers 2).\\n\\nhttp://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/\"}\n",

There\\'s bound to be a vocal percentage of viewers who walk out of \"Iron Man 3\" thinking, \"why didn\\'t he just call his superfriends in the end?\" It\\'s a good question, one that Drew Pearce and Shane Black\\'s script doesn\\'t ignore, but never satisfyingly answers. Yet that doesn\\'t seem to matter. The bigger question that Marvel has addressed is whether it could effectively narrow the scope of its universe again after \"The Avengers\" blew it open—and the answer is yes.\\n\\nTony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) hasn\\'t been the same since his near-death experience in a intergalactic wormhole at the end of \"The Avengers.\" In fact, the words \"New York\" have become a trigger for his newly discovered anxiety attacks. He has spent his funk by building an inordinate amount of Iron Man suits, and specifically a remotely operated suit that he can summon through a biological tracking system. When a terrorist named the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) emerges, hacking U.S. airwaves to spread fear and causing thermal explosions, Tony calls him out on his cowardice, a move he immediately regrets.\\n\\nAs the script continues to introduce all the players in this third iron-clad outing, from Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian—a think tank manager Tony spurned 13 years ago—to Don Cheadle\\'s Col. Rhodes who has a new gig as the stars-and-stripes-studded presidential bodyguard Iron Patriot, the film appears as a sloppy mess likely to meet the same fate as \"Iron Man 2.\" Only when Tony begins to pursue the mystery of the terrorist bombings do all these seemingly disparate pieces begin to come together into what\\'s actually a rather clever story.\\n\\nStory structure aside, the script does boast plenty of Stark quips in case you worried the directorial turnover from Jon Favreau to Shane Black would alter the tone of the franchise. Not even close. If anything, the \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" director pushes the boundaries of political correctness with some of the dialogue, especially in the scenes in which Tony finds himself teamed up with a 12-year-old boy.\\n\\n\"Iron Man 3\" digs deeper into the psychology of Tony Stark, at least more than you\\'d expect from a blockbuster. Rather than open with an action sequence to get the ball rolling, we get a flashback to when Stark met Pearce\\'s Killian as well as a genetic engineer named Maya played by Rebecca Hall. Things don\\'t really begin to pick up until Tony has his mansion blown into the ocean.\\n\\nNot unlike \"Iron Man 2,\" the film\\'s action is largely reserved for the grand finale. Still, the amount of special effects shots is probably tripled, and the action sequences when they do come were written to be as unique and memorable as possible, with a skydiving sequence taking the cake. \"Iron Man 3\" hits big whenever it makes the effort to do so, proving again how Marvel Studios holds a quality entertainment standard rivaled by few.\\n\\nThe \"Iron Man\" films (and this is partly fault of the comic) lack truly excellent villains. This film sets up Tony Stark\\'s greatest nemesis in the Mandarin, but complicates it in a way you\\'ll never see coming considering how studios and writers have flocked toward villains in the mold of Heath Ledger\\'s Joker from \"The Dark Knight.\"\\n\\nThe movie gambles in that way and in other ways not all audiences will recognize. Take the boy for example. If the film failed on the whole, it would forever be remembered as \"the \\'Iron Man\\' movie with Tony Stark and that kid.\" That\\'s dangerous territory. If \"Spider-Man 3\" had worked, everyone wouldn\\'t refer to it as \"the one with emo Peter Parker.\"\\n\\nNothing gambles more than the script, which spends a lot of time setting up the premise for what it hopes will be an effective payoff. So much of the film seems anecdotal until you see how the pieces fit. Even then, there\\'s no guarantee the audiences will be compelled by the completed puzzle, but \"Iron Man 3\" goes bold enough to surprise in a good way.\\n\\nThe humor definitely misfires at times and the sense of danger doesn\\'t pervade the film from start to finish, but considering how must third installments have sputtered (\"Spider-Man 3,\" \"X-Men: The Last Stand\"), it\\'s testament to a number of quality components at work behind the scenes, not excluding \"The Avengers,\" which clearly reenergized Iron Man as a solo character. Without it, no way \"Iron Man 3\" opens with nearly $175 million after the critical disappointment toward the second.\\n\\nFew actors have truly created and owned a character like Downey Jr. and Tony Stark. Without him, Iron Man is just a second-class superhero in Marvel\\'s canon. He single-handedly launched Phase One of Marvel Studios\\' plan and gave audiences a multi-dimensional hero with both despicable and lovable qualities. If he powers down the suit after \"The Avengers 2,\" it\\'ll be the end of an era.\\n\\n~Steven C\\n\\nThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more'}\n",

I want to write about this before the general thoughts: by now you may know the \"twist\", but why even say that? The entertainment comes from going in cold, after all, and it\\'s the kind of thing that has drawn audiences down in a polar sort of way. You find out what is really going on with a character, and it... is hilarious. For me. It does something different, it alters the expectations that come with such a blockbuster that delivers the same-old same-old, and most of all, the filmmakers understand that they can make a point here too, as Iron Man did in 2008: a little statement about the world we\\'re living in, in that case it was the militarization of the third world, and here it\\'s media manipulation. It doesn\\'t over-do it; and the actor\\'s revelation is just splendid. I can see why it\\'d p-off some folks though, especially if you really really really wanted to see this particular character.\\n\\nThis would be higher up on the list of Marvel movies in general, except for one really irksome character flaw at the end.

It seemed like such a needless act, even for the likes of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), especially as we in the audience know how many more times Stark will return in the suit in future films (whether it\\'s *only* Avengers 2 or other films, it\\'s not a question of if but how much).\\n\\nAnd yet, aside from this, it\\'s a fun summer movie that takes some real chances – Ben Kingsley, nuff said – and always keeps its heart in the right place as Stark, who faces some big risks with the likes of the Mandarin and Guy Pearce\\'s Killian, doesn\\'t stop for a sarcastic barb, a moment of self-conscious knowing, and Black as writer/director keeps the action, humor, thrills, and spectacle moving at an intelligent, coherent clip, not to mention Downey, who fills the role and conflicts of Stark with bravura as always. It was the only summer blockbuster I could stand seeing more than once (though I really tried for another HUGE spectacle, which we\\'ll get to in a moment).'}\n",

Together with screen writer and Marvel comic Creator Stan Lee they surpass themselves. The movie proves to be an exciting, sky jaunting, world traveling explosion for the mind. The story continues the saga of handsome Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), who is a Billionaire and inventive genius. From the creative mind of Marvel comics, writer Stan Lee, comes this third segment of the Iron Man. In this chapter, we find Stark in a fitful state while his active mind is unable to allow his body to rest or sleep. As such he is ripe for an attack from his newest enemy called Mandarin ( Ben Kingsley) who promises to destroy Iron Man. The first attack is to Starks\\' Malibu home which Mandarin destroys with three guided missiles. Among all the things which Tony loses is his beautiful beach-side home, his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his wealth which leaves him destitute and homeless. Crashing on the ground in the state of Tennesse, Stark realizes he must start again. He does this with the help of Jarvis, (Paul Bettany) his Robotic aid, Harley Kenner (Ty Simpkins) an orphan boy who inspires Tony to rebuild himself and James Rhodes (Dom Cheadle) who reprises his role as his Military friend. Together they take on the International criminal called Manderin (Ben Kingsley) and his major henchman called Aldrich Killian. (Guy Pearce). The movie is filled with high drama, Damsel rescues, Presidential protection, high flying chills and thrills and explosive combat displays. The reckless pursuit of action scenes is what drives this movie. The cast which included Miguel Ferrer as Vice President Rodriguez is exceptional and lends itself to the complete foundation for a real exciting Classic. I fully recommend this movie to all movie fans and friends of Stan Lee. ****'}\n",

The last two Iron Man mostly studies the human complexity of Tony Stark which already makes a pretty compelling film even if it leaves the action as its extra pleasure. In this Iron Man, it is more into the large explosions which is totally right for its source material. In this film, you will find one of the best action sequences of the superhero movie milieu. The plot gets a little messy at times and the morality beneath it is quite obvious, but without a doubt, the film is excessively fun. It's not the best of the franchise but it's still one of its great films.\\n\\nIt's bigger and louder compared to the last two. It tells a larger plot and deals with trickier villains for Tony Stark to play around. We can still root for their world's innovations and characters. The parts that are suppose to be deep are however sometimes contrived and obvious. But the film is thankful to have something to cover up some of its flaws, example is scattering the entire film with humor, and of course, explosions. It's all naturally fun mostly thanks to the cast. Robert Downey Jr. is still brilliant as Tony Stark and he explores more of the character. His backup are also as charming. For the villains, Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce take a little camp and they seem to enjoy it, but Pearce brings it to the table in the end.\\n\\nShane Black takes the director's chair this time. He is known for Lethal Weapon and the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. He gives a brand new direction to the series. Unlike what the promotional posters and trailers have shown to us, the film is still not that dark toned but it has more serious threats. Black knows how to balance the serious and comedic moments. The first half though takes the roots of the original by showing Stark's imperfectness. The rest is simply an easy redemption. It's a clever move for a sequel that is suppose to be bigger than its predecessor. The action is thrilling as it is suppose to be. One of the film's memorable action is the scene(briefly shown in trailer) when Iron Man is trying to save a bunch of falling passengers from a plane. It is a sequence that is simply electrifying. This comment might sound like a hyperbole, but whatever, it is unobjectionably breathtaking. Then there's more at the climax where you'll get a taste of glorious explosions.\\n\\nIron Man 3 tricks the audience for a deeper theme. That certain theme was solved way too easily in the end and the film rather focused on staying to the natural tone of the Avengers universe and that's fine. Besides, we're already done of seeing superheroes fall and being defeated throughout the film until the climax. The whole point is that great heroes become better heroes thanks to their weaknesses. The most noticeable thing you would spot here is when Iron Man's armor is keep crashing and falling apart and Tony's anxiety caused by what he did in The Avengers. It's comical but it's an interesting speculation. Many would still say the original is the best because it is indeed better in plot and character development, but for those who are seeking for better action will definitely love this as well. It is just way too fun. Iron Man 3 may not be the most compelling in subject but it's already a compelling experience you'll get in an action blockbuster.\"}\n",

Soon it begins you will forget everything but the only focus on the movie and the story. Like other two 'Iron Man' I liked this third movie as well but this movie was a little lacked in high-octane action stunts. But still no short for an entertainment.\\n\\n'Iron Man 3' one of a most anticipated movie of the year. I still don't understand this movie and 'Avenvegers' are connected or separate stream stories because Tony behaves like there's one like he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder. Anyway this movie was a bit more dramatised than stunts, it tells his earlier time mistake which creates a deadly enemy for the present. I always wondered such a good actress, Gwyneth Paltrow, appearances in earlier two movies were so wasted. At least she gets some improvise role here, maybe we can expect more from her in the next movie in the series I guess.\\n\\nI totally loved the Ben Kingley's cameo though I easily guessed the twist on his role. More or less this movie's success made 'Iron Man' trilogy to one of a fine trilogy ever. A good movie to watch once, especially if you ever liked 'Iron Man' duology or any other sci-fi- action movies.\\n\\n8/10\"}\n",

This is supposed to be a fun summer movie. That is a concept you have to get your head around. Another one is, that Shane Black is back. And I\\'m thankful for that. I was so excited after \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\", but unfortunately it wasn\\'t a commercial success. And though he has proved that he has talent (in writing and also in directing, see his biography), it seemed like Hollywood was done with him.\\n\\nFortunately Robert Downey Jr. comes along and with the power he now has, can say: I want him as director. Not sure if it happened exactly like that, but whatever the circumstances, I\\'m glad he is able to do projects now with the Iron Man 3 success backing him up. As for Downey Jr. he seems to be bargaining for a new deal as Mr. Tony Stark. And he probably will get what he wants. Good for him.\\n\\nBut what about the movie itself? The action is amazing (budget wise you couldn\\'t expect anything less), but there is also a lot of wit in it. The script oozes with clever remarks and great quotes! Trademark Black! There is also clever hints and word plays (concerning the last events of the Avengers that is) and Tony Stark does have another evolution to go through. Great casting and especially great idea with Sir Ben Kingsley. Another \"Black-ish\" element that is added to the mix.

Well, actually, there is a story, of sorts, but it is so superficial as to render it moot. This movie is proof that special effects alone do not make for a good movie, or for even a fair movie. When Miss Penny has to bail out Iron Man, that's a sure sign that the script department is desperate. But that aside, the story is so shallow and the bad guys so predictable that the movie loses dramatic power, rendering it stale. Of course, this can happen when a comic book story is transposed onto the screen. If not portrayed correctly, the story will not be taken seriously, and the movie tanks. Iron Man 1 and 2 managed to avoid that problem; this movie does not. As a result, we have an Iron Man who offers nothing new and is dealing with bad guys who are laughable. Ben Kingsley's performance is a joke. Robert Downey Jr. is, as usual, excellent as Iron Man, but without a viable script, his presence cannot save this movie from its mediocrity, and who wants to watch mediocrity?\\n138 out of 278 found this helpful.

If this movie is any indication, I think we are off to a very good start. All things considered, this may be the best film in the Iron Man franchise to date. The story arc keeps getting better, especially when Tony Stark takes off with Nolan-esque emotions and of course, with the rather infamous twist that I happened to like. The CGI is the best of the series and that is evident in the action-packed scenes involving all the suits. I guess it\\'s true that better technology means better effects.\\n\\nShane Black, known for his extraordinary writing skills, directs the third installment in the Iron Man franchise. Several months after the events of The Avengers, Stark has not been himself as he suffers from post traumatic disorder. But he must get into gear quick as a terrorist organization known as \\'The Mandarin\" begins to create havoc in the world.\\n\\nAs always with the Iron Man films, the acting is very good. Robert Downey Jr. is spot-on as Tony Stark. Despite his depression at times, he manages to keep the clever wit that we all love. Gwyneth Paltrow has some shining moments as Pepper. Ben Kingsley makes a very fine addition to the cast as the Mandarin, and of course having talents like Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall helps as well. We also might have to keep an eye out on Ty Simpkins, the young boy that Stark grows pretty close to. He may be a star one day.\\n\\nOverall, Iron Man 3 is an action-packed, character-driven film and it continues the success of above-average superhero films. Scores of people bash on the twist, but I think it was excellent and it added some light-heartiness to the movie. I liked the addition of a voice-over because it seems to have added more feeling to the movie. The CGI is excellent and those flying suits were a great achievement. Now with Iron Man 3 behind us, I\\'m eagerly awaiting the next Marvel installment. I rate this movie 9/10.'}\n",

I came out of this one feeling like I had seen a real comic-book brought to life rather than something masquerading as meaningful and thought provoking (The Dark Knight trilogy, I'm talking about you!). The film's light-hearted moments also make it much easier to accept the more outlandish sequences, which is a good job because the mayhem here is turned up to eleven, with more crash, bang and wallop for your money than ever before.\\n\\nI do, however, have one gripe with part three: the ending suggests that they might not be making a part four.

Not only that but he has also earned the enmity of a mad scientist by the name of \"Aldrich Killian\" (Guy Pearce). Now, not wanting to spoil the film for those who haven\\'t seen it I will just say that there are some twists involved which deviate from the original plot and serve this movie quite well. Having said that let me also state that I am not a big fan of action movies that consist of simply action and CGI. And while this film has plenty of both there is also some good acting on the part of Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce. Additionally, there is a good story to be had here too. Be that as it may, I would like to advise those who haven\\'t seen this movie to see \"The Avengers\" or possibly one of the other two \"Iron Man\" films before watching this one if for no other reason than to have a little bit of continuity.

Smart, action packed, and brilliantly acted, Iron Man was the best Marvel Comics movie yet. But the follow up two years later was something of a disappointment. Iron Man 2 was by no means a bad movie, and it certainly had its moments, but it simply didn't capture the awesomeness of its predecessor. Now the third installment has remedied most of its flaws, delivering summer entertainment that's fully satisfying, if not quite equal to the first film.\\n\\nIron Man 3 is not the kind of movie to waste much time on set up. From the get go it's clear that all is not well for Tony. He's got his suits and the woman he loves, his company is on stable footing, but there's a shadow looming over him. Because there's a new enemy striking at America from the shadows. A terrorist mastermind who can attack anywhere, anytime leaving no trace but broken bodies and smoldering wreckage. When challenged, he will stretch Tony to his very limits, taking everything that Iron Man can throw at him. And his name is Mandarin.\\n\\nThis is what every fanboy has been waiting for. As great a villain as Obadiah Stane was, the first movie still left one question in the back of my mind; what about the Mandarin? Where is Iron Man's oldest and deadliest foe? This question became more pressing as Tony battled B-list villains like Whiplash and Justin Hammer during the second film. Well now the arch nemesis is here, along with AIM founder Aldrich Killian and a small army of super powered enforcers. And when we finally meet him, he's the absolute last thing you would expect. Purists will no doubt complain about how far the Mandarin has been taken from his source material, but I've got to say that the version they've come up with here is simply brilliant.\\n\\nThe rest of the plot line is also excellent by summer blockbuster standards. Though it draws on key points from the recent Extremis, Haunted, and World's Most Wanted story arcs, the story here is completely new and rarely predicable, even to those who are well read in the comics. The villains' scheme is truly masterful, and there are some excellent twists and suitably shocking revelations towards the end.\\n\\nAnd of course there's plenty of action, and it rocks. By now we've seen that Tony can take on nearly anything in his armor, which is why the movie does the smart thing and forces him to go without for an extended period of time. With only bits and pieces of his tech to help him, the tension is greater and Tony has to rely more on his wit and skill than massive firepower. Of course there are some awesome action scenes when he is suited up, particularly the mid air rescue sequence. And the best has been saved for last in a massive free-for-all involving Tony, Rhodes, Pepper, and more than a dozen sets of armor against the Mandarin's forces.\\n\\nThis is a very fun movie. Robert Downy junior is as awesome as ever, and he's been given a lot to work with. That's not to say that Iron Man 3 is perfect. I never really bought the whole panic attack thing, and I'm not sure the movie needed a pint sized sidekick, though I admit he did produce some good comic relief. And it just didn't feel quite as slick or as evenly paced as the original. But it comes very close, and it's definitely one of the better movies you'll see this summer.\"}\n",

There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.\\n\\nThe same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.\\n\\nThese two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.\\n\\nThis film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness.

The characters all feel very 3-dimentional and fleshed out, and none of them feel different from what we already know. The movie\\'s biggest strength is the interactions between the characters, and the different arguments presented by both sides. I love that despite obviously wanting us to side with Cap\\'s team, the movie doesn\\'t really make one side the \"correct\" one. Both sides present reasonable and logical arguments, and there is no right answer to what the Avengers should do. The new characters such as Black Panther and Spiderman are both very interesting and compelling, and both feel like a natural inclusion to the character list. All this is of course helped by some excellent performances as usual. The direction and cinematography are also both really good, and the action scenes are almost just as good as in Winter Soldier, even though some feel a little meaningless. And, while it might not be a big deal, MAN was it good to see a truly great antagonist in Zemo. He\\'s well written and very well played by Daniel Brühl, and he challenges the ideological perspectives of our hero in a way no other villain in the MCU has done before. With that being said, his plan is somewhat ridiculous, and felt a little too complicated. The movie also feels a little dumb sometimes. It feels like Cap and Stark could\\'ve solved the issue much sooner had they just communicated better. Those are my main complaints, and while there are a few other things I could nitpick, nothing really ruins the film by any means. It\\'s a more mature take on the Marvel formula, and while it\\'s the best movie in the franchise, it\\'s still more than good enough for me to recommend it.'}\n",

Fantastic Four was an abysmal film and it made less than Spy Kids 3D: Game Over. Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice received terrible reviews and had one of the biggest Friday to Sunday drops. Are people sick of these films? Well, not if you\\'re in the Marvel family it seems. For one thing, Marvel actually takes pride and careful attention to detail with their films, both the previously mentioned titles are rush jobs for specific reasons. Civil War is proof that the good guy vs good guy aspect of superhero films can be done right.\\n\\nThe world wants to hold the Avengers accountable for all the death and destruction they\\'ve caused over the years, so the United Nations put together the Sokovia Accords, which means the Avengers would work for them. Tony Stark supports this. Steve Rogers does not. Things get more complicated when Bucky turns up again and is the prime suspect in a bombing that kills dozens of people. With two prominent members of the Avengers on opposing sides of the issue, will the team ever be the same again?\\n\\nCivil War has a lot going for it. Stellar cast, great characters, top-notch special effects, excellent action sequences, comedic relief and...well the list goes on. The Russo brothers have delivered a slick action film that makes me comfortable with the fact that they seem to be at the helm of the Marvel franchise now. When The Avengers was first announced, I thought it was going to be dreadful, then they said these guy named Joss Whedon was going to be directing it and my expectations instantly changed. Whedon delivered a great superhero film that set up the rest of the films to come. The Russo brothers now have the task of juggling all these characters and they do an admirable job.\\n\\nEach character has their shining moments, but the core of the story is Stark vs Rogers. So while it\\'s fun to have Rudd come in and have a few laughs, I don\\'t think anyone is expecting huge things from his character. Same with Spider-Man, who is forced in here to set up his future films within this weird shared universe with Sony. Those are not complaints, they both work wonderfully in the film. If I were to find a complaint it would be in the thought process of the villain, Zemo. His plan is so painstakingly convoluted that I wonder how it even worked at all. Too many things need to fall in place for him to get what he wants and it distracts from the emotional power of the climax. The actors and the history with the characters manage to save it a bit and do raise the stakes, but I had my problems nonetheless.\\n\\nThe grand spectacle at the airport between these characters was indeed a highlight. When you have characters like Vision and Scarlet Witch, who are so powerful they could end the fight instantly, it\\'s a good idea to have them simply do damage control. I wondered how they would handle these two, they did a decent job of it. After this film, I can only hope that Infinity Wars goes this route and gives each Avenger a worthy foe to fight and not a hoard of mindless foot soldiers, which is exactly what the previous two Avengers films did.\\n\\nFans of the series will be pleased, the action is great (a bit shaky at first, but they let it breath later on) and some great introductions of new characters that will bring a fresh perspective to the franchise. Black Panther for one, steals a lot of the scenes he is in. Bold move to have such a big character \"show up\" in the film without a solo movie to set him up, but it works here. The cast is diversifying as more and more characters come into these films and I\\'m glad to see it. Tony Stark is great, RDJ does a great job with him, but we\\'ve seen the guy have a big role in these films 6 times now. I get that Marvel is scared to let some of these characters go because they are so integral to everything, but I honestly believe something along these lines needs to happen to bring more emotional depth to the franchise. For a studio willing to take chances are projects like Guardians of the Galaxy, they need to take a chance on this aspect as well.'}\n",

For what fans clamor to be a storyline that the MCU is building towards, here comes a showdown of Marvel\\'s biggest properties.\\n\\n\"Captain America 3\" starts off where \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" ended, when the New Avengers, led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), are cornered by international concern in response to continuous collateral damage. As a result, a governing act is proposed to the Avengers, fracturing the team to two sides, one led by Rogers and another led by Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). But when a new threat is on the horizon, the team has to face the repercussions of their brawls.\\n\\nIt is a huge help that the Russo Brothers returned to hold the weights of Marvel\\'s Phase Three, after their spontaneous effort in \"The Winter Soldier\". Though \"Civil War\" may not be as solid as its predecessor, it is still a worthy addition to the Avengers storyline and Captain America\\'s saga. Yet, it excels for taking a mature route that brings a compelling character study, a token from the first Avengers movie. Out of such character study is the major theme of vengeance. I am not going to give any more details about it. It is best to be seen and be enamored by how such themes are delivered with an affecting yet entertaining vibe.\\n\\nKudos to the cast ensemble that all brought their A-game, even though some characters are not that fleshed out, or feeling shoehorned. Evans is at his most moving as the fading patriot who wishes the best for his team and loved ones. Downey Jr. is still what we expected from RDJ. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow has a neutral but affectionate presence, despite her rather little involvement. The rest of the cast is great to see, with notable breakout performances from Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man/Giant-Man, Chadwick Boseman as T\\'Challa/Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. And Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo is a better addition to Marvel\\'s lacking lineup of antagonists. But despite the cast\\'s collective efforts, there is an obvious battle for screen time with all characters. Thankfully, it was all salvaged as the two parties brawl in a cleared airport, in an exhilarating action sequence that will surely make every audience member cheer.\\n\\nFor all the makings of a summer blockbuster, \"Captain America: Civil War\" gets it all started right. Besides being a loyal companion to the comic book storyline, it is a worthy setup to Marvel\\'s other properties and one that truly can hold on its own, courtesy of its consistent superhero action scenes, the Russo brothers\\' tense direction, the excellent cast, its thought-provoking themes and its exciting story with its signature Marvel snappy dialogue. Let us hope for the best for MCU\\'s future, including Tom Holland\\'s \"Spider-Man\".'}\n",

Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any tvspots after the second trailer or whatever! Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them. Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing! Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from the other characters were great! 10/10 Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead-pool.., was the story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki & kingpin in the series. 8/10 Action/Cinematography: O boy..If you're an action freak you will love this, if you're a comic book fan.. you're gonna LIVE these amazing action set pieces. The much anticipated airport scene is AMAZING. You've seen nothing, literally nothing of the amazing action that will bestow upon you guys. The airport scene is in complete imax and has a runtime of around 17 minutes. Just let that sink in! The Russo brothers know how to create great action and film it great as well. I can go on record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever. 20/10. Verdict: Was it a perfect movie? No. But for me as a fan it came darn close. The only thing that bothered me were the villains, well actually one of the few that are in there. Was it better than... Batman v superman.. yes by far. I mean we're in a comic book movie year, so we might as well compare it. Batman v superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better. Just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now after 2 cross over movies, 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies.. the stakes are so incredibly high. I tried to compare dead-pool with it as well, but it's a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and setting something up, instead of showing a conflict between good and good instead of good and evil. 9 out of 10! Near Perfect movie for the fans(9.5) and a good solid action film for the general movie go-ers(9)\"}\n",

It is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions - one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. Civil War is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date, and absolutely on par with The Winter Soldier which was also great. They are both on top in the Marvel Cinematic Movies ranking of mine so far. The conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing Russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first Captain America movie , made one serious and great second movie, and build upon them both with the third outing. Everyone does a great job here, Chris Evans has made Captain America his own same as Robert Downey Jr for Iron Man. It features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role. The fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie, even better than in The Winter Soldier. Especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else that's going on. Spider-Man is also unbelievably well done and Tom Holland is just fantastic. I am one of the few people who actually loved The Amazing Spider Man movies, and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but I can see now that it was worth it. The visuals are great from beginning to end, the music is also good as usual. The villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but I strongly disagree with that. He had reasoning as to why he is doing those things, and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary. I generally adored this movie, and even though I am a DC fan, there's just no denying that Marvel knows what they're doing and that is why they are much more successful right now.\"}\n",

There's no other way to say it: Civil War is phenomenal. Marvel continues the trend of upping the stakes by pinning our favorite heroes against each other: Captain America and Iron Man. There are a lot of other characters, so much so that it feels more like an Avengers movie than a solo movie, but the story is told in such a way that the spotlight is always on Cap and Bucky.\\n\\nCivil War is tonally different from Winter Soldier in that it's more bombastic in its storytelling. Again, there are a lot of Avengers in the movie (more than the freaking Avengers movie). While Winter Soldier was a relatively grounded, dark political thriller, Civil War is a louder, more colorful take on the political theme, and a much more personal one as well. This time it's a matter of morals and ethics, and it's amazing how the movie pulls off giving each side of the argument weight and credibility so you could argue about who's right and who's wrong all day.\\n\\nSteve wants to protect his best friend Bucky who was brainwashed by Hydra and is now a fugitive from the law. He doesn't trust any form of government faction. He saw how far up corruption goes and he's not willing to lose jurisdiction of the Avengers to yet another corrupt governmental body. Tony wants everyone to sign an agreement for the UN so they won't be seen as a threat by the world governments due to their track record of leaving behind messes and casualties. It's a terrific plot, very thrilling and character driven. At its core it's a very personal story between Steve and Tony. The other characters are written as complimentary pieces to one puzzle. It's not gratuitous at all. You understand everyone's ideologies - why they disagree with each other, why they're on the sides that they're on, why they're fighting for what they're fighting for - and they're each given enough screen time for us to care. And the action scenes are TWS level. Nothing quite beats the first confrontation between CA and WS, but the end of the second act of this movie has an action sequence that is absolutely mesmerizing. It's the civil war. Seeing all of these superheros go against each other is exhilarating, and their interactions are hysterical, especially since a lot of them are meeting each other for the first time.\\n\\nThe new characters are excellent - Black Panther makes a hell of an impression as a sophisticated Wakandan diplomat, and Spider-Man is easily the best live action interpretation of the character; major props to Tom Holland for sounding exactly how you'd expect Spider-Man to sound like. It's an absolute joy to watch. One aspect of Civil War I find especially fascinating is the use of its villain, Zemo. You have no idea what he's plotting for a good chunk of the movie. He shows up intermittently as the first couple of acts are playing out doing cryptic stuff vaguely involving Hydra, and finally the third act converges on Zemo and why he's doing what he's doing, and it's about the simplest thing: vengeance. It's incredible to watch this ordinary man - no powers or abilities - just a smart, patient man, have a conceivable shot at destroying the Avengers. And the actor is excellent too. It's a nice change of pace from the invincible demigods and dull dark elves we've been getting in previous installments.\\n\\nCivil War is an expertly made film all around. The acting is top notch as always, the directing and the writing are masterful, I can go on and on. It's a political, personal, and powerfully conveyed story with tons of popcorn blockbuster appeal, rivaled only by The Winter Soldier in the MCU. Highly recommended.\"}\n",

Now its No Hats', 'movie_id': '3498820', 'author': 'A_Different_Drummer9', 'date': 'May 2016', 'content': 'Since it is increasingly important in these reviews to appeal to all readers, and not offend anyone, I am offering two reviews. Simply pick the one you like.\\n\\n1. Great Production Values, Two and a Half Hours of Action, Whats Not to Like?\\n\\nThis, the shorter review, simply states the obvious. Marvel is getting progressively better at delivering action and most people today go to these films for the action, so this is win-win. Yeah. Everyone smile and wait for the next Marvel release. Have your wallets ready.\\n\\n2. As Marvel increasingly monopolizes the Superhero space, the themes get darker and darker.\\n\\nThe early 1920s believe it or not were a lot like today. Everyone sensed a growing unease in the collective gestalt, so they compensated by more partying, less critical thinking, and going to more movies. Interestingly, movies both before and after the Great Depression offered pure escapist entertainment. You went to the movies to get anything BUT reality.\\n\\nA century later, that paradigm has shifted. Ever since the \"graphic novels\" started to tackle serious adult themes, there seems to be a race among superhero writers to see who can put his (her) hero through the most angst, and drag the audience along for the ride.\\n\\nI am not sure this is a good thing but I seem to be in the minority. I have seen a Spiderman movie where Spidey\\'s main squeeze was killed because Spidey was a few seconds late. I have seen Superman movies where the main goal seems to be to discover how many buildings you can smash with Superman\\'s head. And now, picking up on the same thread, I am seeing Avenger movies where governments -- these would be the same governments spying on your emails and trying to ban cash -- are trying to tell the \"enhanced\" humans what to do and not do.\\n\\nNow, the suits at the studio would argue this must be what the audience wants because they are making money. This reviewer would argue that when you have a monopoly on a product line that people want, they will see it regardless. Only one of us is right.\\n\\nIn my view, the best superhero films are the ones that are the most humanistic. Superman comes out of a coma to be with the child he did not know he had. Iron Man rewards a boy who helped him when no one else would. Hulk drops out of an airplane not knowing if he will change or not, but he has to stop the bad guy and protect Betty.\\n\\nMy attitude is, if I want adult themes that badly I don\\'t need to go the theatre, I can simply try to renew my license or wait in a hospital emergency room. I \"get\" this is how they are making superhero films these days. I suggest that in a year or two someone will rediscover the older, more sentimental, story lines, the audience will love it, and people of the future will look back at the films of today and wonder, what were they smoking?\\n\\nComment added 2021 -- With hindsight, the last \"legit\" Avengers movie before the suits decided to burn all the old franchises to the ground and go politically correct, and non-binary. A piece of history.'}\n",

We were shocked to see that the major problem they had in Aquaman 1 was again manifested in this sequel. If you watch a film, you know the kind of tone and feel that a movie is giving you. But this movie feels like a jumbled medley of imitations from different kinds of films, almost like a parody. There's a 10-minute scene where you felt like this is from an Indiana Jones world, and then the next thing you know, you're stuck in the realm of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. We can name a lot of different movies that this film takes its tone and design and pastes it into the movie. War of the Worlds, The Matrix Revolutions, Ridley Scott's Aliens and... okay, we'll stop now. The result is an endless patchwork of downgraded recreations from various movies. It felt like Aquaman had a day at Disneyland going into different kind of movie-themed rides (minus the 'fun').\\n\\nAdding to that, the first act felt like it was venturing into a documentary style format mixed with Ridley Scott's Alien style of exposition. Alien was a masterpiece but like we said, this is a dumpster reiteration, it was slow, it had little to no suspense, it tried to build momentum but it didn't work. They could have cut 10 minutes but they didn't. It was unnecessarily drawn out as they spent time showing the entirety of their journey into the deep unknown like this is some kind of art house film.\\n\\nNow, a lot are asking, is Amber Heard in it? Well, yes. Did she have many scenes? Her presence was only about 15% of the whole film. Her character, Mera did play a pivotal role for the story but James Wan, the director knew when to show her on screen. The question, 'Is her presence important on screen?' seems like what James Wan would ask himself before making the decision to put her in. She only had few dialogues but her performance was still flat.\\n\\nWe also have a problem with how much they made use of 'space'. Especially in the first act, we saw they're a lot of wide shots used but the issue here is the space that filled in those shots; the surroundings, locations or/and environments were only there because... they were made to be there. It barely did anything to the story. But when it comes to scenes that were crowded or had various props or extras, the cameras ddin't give audience the time to breathe and process the visuals. A lot of mid to fast cuts, there wasn't much of a sense of appreciation to enjoy the visuals they have built. In the end, we felt discontented.\\n\\nFirst Aquaman at least had villains that were enjoyable to watch. This time, the villain or again, villains were just forgettable. The motivations were weak. The main villain didn't really drive the story forward. It had a backstory and conflict that were created merely for the purpose of this movie's existence. We couldn't care less because it's nowhere interesting, let alone enjoyable.\\n\\nAnd talking about that final battle... oh man. It was unbearable to the point that it turned laughable. Was it because of the reshoots that they suffered here? The whole movie, led to the final battle, it was a journey between Aquaman and his brother, only for us to find out that the villain was feeble and it gave the benefit of the plot armor for Aquaman and his weapon. It's just bad storytelling on top of bad execution overall.\\n\\nAnd the movie draggggggsssssss so much, we even questioned, 'What happened to James Wan?' From the beginning up until the climax, we were just waiting for something cool or unique to happen, but it didn't. It drags until the final battle where it should be longer but then that's when they decided to just cut things off and ended it abruptly the moment the exciting thing was about to pop up. We're confused.\\n\\nAmidst these flaws, one thing that truly stood out is its message on brotherhood. A beautiful message combo with good pairing, Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson have commendable chemistry, we can see it from the way they talk to each other. There's certainly some dedication they put into establishing their relationship. It's nothing that you can remember for years but it's enough to at least carry this movie despite the many bad outcomes this movie turned out to be.\\n\\nUltimately, Aquaman 2 seems tailored for a younger audience who just want to enjoy monsters and sea creatures fighting against literally anything or anyone, rather than catering to teenagers or adults seeking a compelling narrative.\\n\\nVerdict: Similar to its predecessor, this sequel fails to find its identity, drowning in an ocean of borrowed tones and styles from previous movies. With a shallow story, forgettable villains and inconsistent pacing, this film struggles to stay afloat. While it's a tidal wave of disappointing results, the portrayal of brotherhood between the two leads stands out as a beacon, carrying the entire movie. Overall, this final chapter from the DCEU serves as a testament we're in dire need for a total reboot of these superheroes.\"}\n",

Where the first film was hardly a masterpiece of the genre I thought it was over the top in all the right ways and because of that I actually mostly enjoyed it. This movie just doubles down on the insanity in all the worst ways and I ended up finding it borderline insufferable.\\n\\nFor the first 15 minutes or so I thought I could enjoy it in a so bad it's good sort of way but it's too stupid to even enjoy in that way. The script just makes so many errors on the most basic level that if you think about any thing about this story for more than a minute it just collapses. Nothing that gets set up pays off in any meaningful way and most of the resolutions fell totally flat. It can't decide on a tone, it drags majorly and most of the humour made me cringe in all the worst ways.\\n\\nThe performances really suffer as a result cause they're pretty poor across the board. I've liked Jason Momoa as this character but he's just too campy in this movie to take anything he's doing seriously, even actors of Yahya Abdul-Manteen II and Nicole Kidman's calibre deliver their lines in the flattest way possible but with the material they're given I can hardly blame that on them. I'm happy that Willem Dafoe was spared from this mess at least.\\n\\nThe finale is the most bog standard CGI noise of a climax that we've seen so many times before that I was just totally bored watching it, at least the first film had some sense of spectacle to it. There's the odd fun action scene but the pretty dreadful visual effects just constantly took me out of it. The villain is terrible after a decent set up in the first film with the most generic motivations possible.\\n\\nThe Lost Kingdom ends the DCEU with the biggest thud imaginable. It's been up and down since the beginning but it deserved a better conclusion than the soulless slog that this movie turned out to be. This might be the worst movie they ever made because at least Justice League had a happy conclusion with the Snyder Cut. There's nothing in this movie you haven't seen 100 times before and I've never been more ready for a total reboot of this universe.\"}\n",

The first Aquaman movie is absolutely ridiculous but I enjoyed it because it didn't take itself too seriously and understand what the movie was. I thought it had a fun energy and went bonkers in the best way. However, all the fun, energy and bonkers entertainment is just thrown out of the window with this sequel because this sequel is a gigantic mess.\\n\\nThe narrative continues from the previous movie with new settings and concepts introduced and while I did like they introduced new settings that are pretty cool. Unfortunately, the writing feels really convoluted because the concepts and ideas were messy as if the writers didn't know how to put the concepts well-together. With all the reshoots and drama happening behind the scenes, I can't be surprised that the structure had fallen apart. Many of the special effects, production, make-up, and the colorful presentation are pretty rough and there are some noticeable poor CGI used but not like The Flash situation. The soundtrack is annoying and the action and thrills were just okay. Many of the cast members are doing their best but unfortunately, the performances weren't great and the dialogue was pretty bad. I honestly feel bad for Yahya Abdul-Mateen II cause he's talented and the character of Black Manta is pretty cool, but Mateen doesn't really get his chances to shine with his character.\\n\\nDirector James Wan is talented as I enjoyed many of his works and I can see Wan is trying his best to create the sequel like the first one, but his direction was really bad as it feels sloppy and inconsistent. The sequel tries to follow the same non-serious 80s cheesy style, humor and tone from the previous movie but it doesn't work because the sequel kind of misses the point of what made the first one entertaining and ends up being pretty cringeworthy.\\n\\nI knew this movie wasn't going to be great and I just wanted to have dumb popcorn entertainment. Some dumb fun and laugh for the cheesiness but wow, it surprised me on how bad it was.\\n\\nOne of the worst movies I have seen this year. Also from DC.\"}\n",

It's a very interesting story that discusses many aspects like family, brotherhood, fatherhood, and leadership. But, perhaps this was its core problem, that it was trying to be so many things at the same time. At times i didn't know where the story was heading which made the story jump from discussing topics like fatherhood to an adventure with two brothers who had beef in their past. The film is unfortunately a typical superhero film in terms of expecting what's coming next from events, and sequences.\\n\\nOn top of that and with all the chaos, the film re-discusses the villain's story which revolves around his revenge but it was so weak comparing to how it was in the first film. I didn't feel his presence nor i felt his evilness. He was suppose to be much stronger here but i barely felt him. The film also brings back old characters that just all of a sudden showed up in some sequences to save the day and be the superhero of the act which felt so weird because they came out of nowhere.\\n\\nThe film's CGI is okay at most times. It's defiantly not as good as the first one but it is for sure better than most of the MCU's latest projects this year like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023). The cinematography unfortunately got downgraded which is something that I was anticipated for especially after seeing the first part. But I felt like there was no room for that because of how messy the sequences and story was especially that we were jumping between the past and present a lot and from one place to another.\\n\\nNot to mention, the whole last sequence of the film was so good in terms of the action sequences and grabbing the audience's attention.

Unfortunately Aquaman 2 has to bear the burden of having to follow through the recent flops and/or mixed bag of superhero output from both MCU/DCEU.\\n\\nJames Wan doesn\\'t offer anything new under sky; a baddie who wants revenge - saw that in the Marvels. Sibling tension? Saw that in Thor. Supposedly all powerful, final-baddie who then gets thumped easily? Saw that in Black Adam. By now, there\\'s such an air of familiarity in superhero fares, that I think it\\' gonna take a complete shift in narrative/plots to offer audiences a fresh take.\\n\\nJason Momoa\\'s charisma and screen presence is basically the backbone of the movie and it pretty much carries it through. His timing, especially humour, is spot on, while his Aquaman is also convincingly authoritative. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II\\'s somewhat wasted here. A capable actor, but he\\'s reduced to portraying a stock baddie out for revenge, while his right arm, Stingray, is as one dimensional as they come. Plus it doesn\\'t help that the actress who plays Stingray is kinda cardboard too.\\n\\nI find Randall Park, while dependable, nevertheless still plays Randall Park from other movies/Tv shows. You\\'ve seen his character in Blockbuster, or in the mcu outfits.\\n\\nDon\\'t have any complaints on Amber Heard or Nicole Kidman, but they don\\'t have enough screen time to make much of an impact. But I have to admit, I did wonder, what if Nicole played Capt. Marvel instead of Brie? I think I would have bought into it a lot faster. Kidman\\'s talent is such that, even small screen time doesn\\'t stop her from exuding enough screen presence to make her contribution count.\\n\\nWhich leaves me with Patrick Wilson. His portrayal of Orm is brilliant, suffusing the character with the tension his inner conflicts have with his motives - \"do I live in hate, or do I forgive?\" The fact that Wilson achieves this without any acting histrionics but leaves his angst just right above the surface, just enough for us to feel it, is probably the standout feature of Aquaman and Lost Kingdom. I think he kinda redeemed himself from the poor and dumb Moonfall.\\n\\nI hope James Gunn will be able to create not only a new trajectory for DCEU, but an entire different take on superhero movies. While Aquaman 2 is entertaining enough to fill your 2h, it\\'s also a by the numbers\\' effort. Not something you and I will live to remember.'}\n",

We're now 3 movies deep, and I still find myself unable to like the character in any capacity.

I wasn't the biggest fan of it though, as by that time, I had already grown tired of the superhero genre, but objectively still, I could see people enjoying it.

To my surprise, it wasn\\'t that bad and I actually enjoyed this film. It wasn\\'t without its problems, but I was pretty satisfied with it being what it was.\\n\\nThe cons of this film are mainly dialogue and CGI. There are all of these cheesy lines that you would expect to hear and one line jokes at the end of a scene, almost like you are watching a sitcom series. Jason Mamoa as an actor has charisma and knows how to steal the show. But unlike the first Aquaman, here it feels as if he\\'s just playing himself.

Yet, beneath the surface, the film reveals itself to be tethered to familiar narrative anchors, wheeling out old tropes that border on the contemptible.\\n\\nOne of the most glaring missteps of \"The Lost Kingdom\" is its treatment of antagonists. The film seems waterlogged with adversaries who lack the depth and complexity needed to elevate the overarching narrative. In contrast to its predecessor\\'s visually stunning underwater landscapes, this sequel disappointingly fails to make waves with its visuals, leaving audiences with a sense of underwhelm.\\n\\nThe original Aquaman film managed to strike a delicate balance, marrying seriousness with elements of fantasy seamlessly. However, \"The Lost Kingdom\" takes a daring detour into cartoonish territory, marking a departure from the established tone. This shift in approach may prove divisive, alienating those who were drawn to the first film\\'s ability to blend epic fantasy elements with a grounded narrative.\\n\\nAs the sequel relentlessly pursues spectacle, it becomes apparent that the quest for visual grandiosity takes precedence over a compelling and innovative storyline. The financial imperative to outdo its predecessor in terms of visual extravagance appears to compromise the significance of delivering a fresh and engaging narrative. In this pursuit of grandeur, \"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\" loses sight of the elements that made the first film a success - a captivating story set against the backdrop of a visually stunning underwater world.\\n\\nStruggling to stay afloat in a sea of expectations, this sequel seems to grapple with the challenge of recapturing the magic that distinguished Aquaman in the superhero genre.

He is just there as something for Aquaman to fight and keep the runtime going.\\n\\nThere is nothing that stands out from this movie to set Aquaman apart from any other superhero. It just exists. The settings are always generic and/or underutilized. The CGI is uninspired. The dialogue sounds like it came from an AI being asked to write the script. There never felt like there were any stakes. I have no reason, even if I was a huge Aquaman fan, to care for literally any of the characters. If a superhero film is going to fail in all of that, at least make the action scenes entertaining. It cannot even succeed in that.\\n\\nJust stay away from this film. It cannot pass even as mindless entertainment. I can only fathom that it was created as a no-effort cash grab by using the Aquaman name with a big-time actor.'}\n",

His character was too silly and inconsistent with how he played the role in the first film. The humor was downright atrocious and forced. The way Aquaman was portrayed was reminiscent of how Thor was portrayed in Love and Thunder. Randall Park also felt out of place throughout this whole film. Amber Heard was also in the film reprising her role. She was honestly okay in the film.\\n\\nThe film focuses too much on the relationship with Aquaman and Orm which once again is cheesy and cliche. Black Manta returns and is probably the best played character. However his character is used to build up something else that ultimately fails to satisfy in the end.\\n\\nThe fight scenes and action were not as good as in the first film and the characters are just not as interesting.

Becoming more Jason Mamoa than Aquaman, the serious badass from the other installments is reduced to a flailing comedian, complete with a goofy battle cry. Black Manta (Yahya Abdul Mateen II) was previously a standout, but the mind control element used here gives him a stale delivery, without adding anything to his character. His henchmen army are given a nauseating amount of screen time and only use it to be increasingly annoying with every seen. The plot is quite similar to the previous film, keeping most of the story beats, but inserting Orm (Patrick Wilson) in the buddy adventure role previously filled by the now scarcely seen Mera (Amber Heard). Orm does his best to make this as watchable as he can, giving the most charming performance in the film. Unfortunately, that is not enough to save it from the astonishingly boring story, with very little memorable moments to make it stand out. Fighting the urge to leave the theater early, I could not help but wish that I waited for this to come to streaming. After a decade of hobbling along, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom brings the DCEU to an end, not with a whimper, but with an embarrassingly shrill yelp.'}\n",

But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!\\n\\nThe whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film.\\n\\nThe cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.\\n\\nWe all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films.\"}\n",

Much is missing but I won't dwell on that, no point, its how well this movie plays out and for me it rolls wonderfully between excitement, thrills and emotional drama towards a satisfactory (though a slightly rushed) conclusion.\\n\\nThere are at least 2 sequences so powerful that I defy anyone not to at least stifle a tear or choke a little. One of those sequence is an exquisitely executed flashback that is pivotal to the whole story.\\n\\nI have to say, that despite the woes we book readers have when elements (big chunks of it too) are omitted from the movies, much credit still has to go to Steve Kloves for adapting the books for the big screen, cleverly weaving, changing and even adding new big elements to give a kinetic flow to the narrative and here it all comes together superbly.\\n\\nDavid Yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors in the last 4 films to blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters with natural tones without overacting. Daniel Radcliffe had to carry this movie more than any other and has done so brilliantly complemented with great support from his two companions, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.\\n\\nPretty much all the characters we have met in all the movies have made an appearance in this finale but one actor stands out, Alan Rickman. His portrayal of Professor Snape has always been a joy to watch (if a little novel) but here his scenes will leave a dramatic engraving in my memory. Here he elevates his portrayal of one of the most complex character in young adult literature to an unforgettable piercingly emotional one.\\n\\nAnother actor who really shines in the few scenes that he has, is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who we see gradually transforming over the past films from the clumsy bullied boy to a brave warrior in this final film. Many other British thespians of the series also have their few moments to shine especially Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagal who was a delight to watch as she takes charge of the defence of Hogwarth School.\\n\\nAs for the spectacle of the battle and showdowns, while not at the scale of Lord of the Rings, I honestly cant think how it could have been done better as the film makers have intertwined heart stopping action with dramatic progressions in the narrative. Its actually more visceral and dynamic than the rather smaller scale battle of the brilliant novels (not to take anything away from Rowling's writing).\\n\\nDo I have any gripes? Yes I do. Although I applaud Steve Kloves for a difficult screenplay adaption...I think he could still have done better at explaining some odd anomalies that only readers of the book will understand. This might annoy you if you haven't read the books. But its a small gripe because what we get is delightful.\\n\\nWhat an amazing achievement to faithfully bring Rowling's epic saga to the big screen with the same cast and largely the same crew, maintaining the brilliant quality right to the end.\\n\\nOh my god, its only just sinking in, this was the end....but what a great great end.\"}\n",

They usually end up being mediocre & unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.\\n\\nDeathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course, if you haven't seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies, you'll be confused to death. Obvious isn't it? It's pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills, plans, and escapes to big and loud battles.\\n\\nThe series doesn't only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It's a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder. Aside from that the film still has its compelling moments like the Prince's Tale scene.\\n\\nNo need to tell about the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the rest of the cast because they are obviously good to their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention and that is Alan Rickman. We already knew him as Snape but there is one scene where we see more of his character and his performance was excellent. The filmmaking, the special effects is obviously good. The music score really made the battle scenes epic and perfect for a final film.\\n\\nFor me it's really hard to write a review about Harry Potter. Is it because I never read the books or I'm not really a huge fan but in my opinion Harry Potter is a successful series. If I rank all the movie conclusions, this could be number three because nothing beats Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Either you're a fan or not, you'll love this series. And yes, this is another remarkable movie series.\"}\n",

After almost a decade, the franchise was coming to an end. I had already read the book, knew the plotting, and remembered the fates of all the characters, but the trailer left me in a near unfathomable state -- the end was coming, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.\\n\\nPicking up practically the exact moment where the first half of the left off, the film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) still on the trail for the elusive Horcruxes that make up Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul. Rather quickly, it becomes apparent that the group will need to travel back to Hogwarts, and it is there that the final battle to determine the fate of the wizarding community, and the world at large, begins.\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a fitting finale for one of the best and most consistent series of the past decade. It is a simply wondrous spectacle that extends and concludes the story wonderfully. While the story and effects are just as great as always, it is the final battle we have all been waiting for that delivers in spades. It is everything you imagined it would be and more. Splitting the films may still be a debatable decision, but the film is able to stand on its own much the same way the previous part did. It is that good, and that gripping. It may be the shortest Harry Potter film, but it is also the only one that feels like it knows exactly where it wants to navigate itself to with each new scene.\\n\\nGrint, Watson and especially Radcliffe are simply stunning in their performances. They have grown up with these characters, and have gotten progressively stronger as actors with each new film. But here, they have totally immersed themselves into their roles, and the results are nothing short of magical. They are exactly how you remember them written in the book, and move from sadness, to courageous, to fearful, and more, with such passion and conviction that you forget they are simply acting. Their styles are that strong, and help provide the emotional crux the film leans on and never from.\\n\\nEven with their varying screen times, the supporting cast is impeccable as always. Alan Rickman is spectacular and simply devastating as the devious Professor Snape. Maggie Smith finally gets some real time to shine as Professor McGonagall, as does Julie Walters as Molly Weasley (who gets the greatest line in the film). Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, George Harris, Tom Felton, Michael Gambon and Matthew Lewis also perfect their characters, and help deliver awesome performances all around.\\n\\nBut the supporting screen time is dominated by Fiennes as Voldemort. When Harry and his friends are not the focal point, Fiennes simply owns everyone. His performance always ranked amongst the best of the series, and he does not let the finale slow him down. He is horrifically evil in his interpretation, and frequently compares to his absolutely and terrifyingly brilliant performance as Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. The fear that courses through the characters' veins at the very sight or mention of his name, courses equally through the audience. Even when he is being darkly hilarious, Fiennes is downright petrifying. He is the stuff that nightmares are made of. His work is just that close to perfect in the role that it gives an almost genuine authenticity that should not come so effortlessly.\\n\\nBut like all Harry Potter films however, the cohesive product is not without its faults.\\n\\nMy main gripe with the film come out of the sheer fact that because it was split off into two parts, it allowed some of the more useless and careless sections of prose to make it into the film. Much like the extended and excruciatingly long camping trip from the first half, the second half gets dragged down by the addition of standout moments from the book that felt awful the first time you read them, and come off even worse on the screen. I know they are pandering to the audience, and adding just as much as they possibly could to make the film feel complete, but there was a reason so much was cut out of the other books when they made the leap to the big screen. This is the shortest of the saga by a long shot, and the chaotic pace makes it feel like it could have been even shorter had they chopped more out.\\n\\nMy other gripe is the 3D. The filmmakers said they did not have the right amount of time to convert the first half properly, so they just scrapped the plans. The movie looked amazing anyway, and I found myself puzzled at what exactly would have been three-dimensional about it about the second part. Save for a scene early on involving a rather badly rendered dragon, there is not much else that takes advantage of the added 3D. The majority of the film just looks and acts normal, never exploring the format, and never giving the audience a reason to care or change their minds on the quickly dying trend.\\n\\nIn what feels like a blink of the eye, the Harry Potter film series is over. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has arrived, and with it, an incredible end to the franchise. It stumbles in some places because of the inane and disappointing prose of the book, but the filmmakers have stayed true to their book and film fans, and delivered a tremendously worthy finale. It is one of the strongest films of the year, and one of the best film finales ever conceived.\\n\\n8.5/10.\\n\\n(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).\"}\n",

It's been a long, bumpy ride, with some films stronger than others - mainly the first few (in my own honest opinion). After a while, however, it all felt like the biggest cinematic tease ever. I mean, we've been told about Voldermort ever since the beginning, and we've known all along that the saga will end with this big, epic fight between good and evil... err, I mean Harry vs. Voldermort. However, that never came (except for a few teases here and there), and when the producers decided to postpone the inedible and split the last film into two, it became ever so frustrating.\\n\\nThanks god, then, that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 came along to right all the wrongs the previous films have made and to give us the proper closure we've all been waiting for. Finally, after all this time, we get to see the main protagonist for more than a glance. We get resolutions to plot lines that began in parts 6 & 7, Hogwarts makes an awesome comeback for one, final stand between forces between both sides, and there are even some twists and turns that echo all the way back to parts 1 & 2.\\n\\nSo yes, THIS is the Harry Potter we've all been waiting for all along: edgy, dark, more mature and complex than ever before, with solid performances from all involved (especially Ralph Fiennes, who gets some space to play with his character, and that guy that plays Neville Longbottom, who grew up to become quite a man from that mousy little kid he once was). But more so - and unlike any of the other films in the series – HP7b stands as an independent piece (alongside its 2010 counterpart), and doesn't leave the viewer unsatisfied. Here, we get a proper ending, we know this is the Harry Potter to end all 800 or so films that came before, and it seems that the producers knew this and gave it all they could. I only wish they've done this more often during the previous films, instead of saving the best for last.\\n\\nAll in all, this is THE best Harry Potter I've seen from all the eight, and a truly exciting roller coaster of a film, filled with top notch storytelling alongside impressive special effects (even the 3D felt appropriate and relevant). I gave it a very solid 9 out of 10.\"}\n",

The heartbreaking death of Paul in that terrible car crash has made this movie so special to the heart of the long standing fans. The script can be so cliché and full of inconsistencies, this movie is the last film of Paul Walker and will always be.\\n\\nBut what makes me to give that high note is the ending scene and the awesome tribute the rest of the fast and furious 'familia' made to Paul. They could have gotten his character to die like we have seen so many times in the past. Instead the scriptwriters rewrote the script to make a celebration of life and family.\\n\\nIn fact, This entire saga is more about family than cars. Cars and race are just the theme and the objects attracting our attention. But the most important part of that story is the strong relationship between the characters and their interprets who are as linked in real life as they are in the movie. Each time one of their own dies they face it together as the actors are actually doing it with the loss of Paul the only REAL loss of this community. And this is what is making this beautiful.\"}\n",

It is an entertaining fun fast paced action film and that really a good one. But it is not perfect I have issues with the film which I will get to it but first I want to write goods about this film.I can\\'t wait till I watch The Fate of the Furious I am getting on Blu-ray next week so yesterday I re-watch this film and I have enjoy it.\\n\\nFurious 7 is the seventh installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the sixth highest-grossing opening of all time. The film has grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide – more than the franchise\\'s first five installments combined – making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise after just twelve days, the third highest-grossing film of 2015 and the sixth highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, The Fate of the Furious, was released on April 14, 2017.\\n\\nThe film\\'s about Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O\\'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), until Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts the team in danger once again.\\n\\nThe cast includes: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham.\\n\\nI like this flick they action is crazier than ever, there\\'s some unnecessary camera moves and this one needs an even bigger suspension of disbelief, it barely pauses in between set pieces. Kurt Russell is in this and like I have said in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 my review I hated his performance in that movie but in here I loved him he was awesome and a really good guy and likable. He has more to do in this film than he did in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto is always terrific and a bad-ass I absolutely love him. Jason Statham is a crazy motherf***** in this I have enjoyed him I always wanted Statham as a bad guy. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz Dom\\'s girlfriend was hot as always I have simply enjoyed her. The rest of the cast was alright.\\n\\nThe issues with the film I have is: Why is shaky cam in the beginning of the fights between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham and on the end of the fights between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham that really hurts this film. I got a migraine because of the shaking cam.\\n\\nDwayne Johnson was only in the beginning of the film and for the rest of the film he was departure he appeared only on the end of the film in the final showdown I only wish he would be more in this film and he would have more to do but I still have enjoyed his performance awesome.\\n\\nJordana Brewster as Mia Toretto is useless in this movie she doesn\\'t do nothing her character is just wasted and useless. I don\\'t know why they put her character in this movie. Lucky Michelle Rodriguez fulfill the emptiness in Dom\\'s crew.\\n\\nCar\\'s with flying parachutes also doesn\\'t fit in the film because of the metal weight parachutes can\\'t hold that kind of metal and some unnecessary CGI was used in this film that also hurt the movie.\\n\\nThose are all the issues I have, I can\\'t wait for The Fate of the Furious to see it I heard it is a good film.\\n\\nThe rating this film get\\'s is a A 9/10 I would have give it 10 but those issues in my opinion hurt the film.\\n\\nPaul Walker died in November 30 2013 so his two brothers Caleb and Cody Walker replaced him and they help to make this film right so I have enjoy from all three brothers performance. R.I.P. Paul Walker my favorite actor and my all time favorite character of the franchise Brian O\\'Conner. This film is dedicated to his memory which I love.\\n\\nFurious 7 (alternatively known as Fast & Furious 7 and Fast 7) is a 2015 American action film directed by James Wan and written by Chris Morgan.

Over the top, like I like it.', 'movie_id': '2820852', 'author': 'Finfrosk8621', 'date': 'September 2015', 'content': 'For the absolutely most part I really enjoyed this action movie.\\n\\nThis is exactly the kind of action that I really like. Extreme action. Action that does not try to be \"realistic\" at all. Over the top action. (and I really hate people that can\\'t accept extreme action, they be all like: \"yeah, right, that\\'s SO unrealistic\"! Dumb people.\\n\\nHere\\'s what I don\\'t like. I have to say I have a slight problem with Vin Diesel. I mean, he\\'s alright, it\\'s just, compared to Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, he\\'s just, well he kind of pales in comparison. His character is also slightly annoying. With his family-talk all the god damn time. We get it, you\\'re into family, the only thing that matters is family, your little gang is family. Family. Family. And hose gravelly grunts he speaks in, ain\\'t cool bruh. Sometimes you can barely make out what he is saying.\\n\\nThe movie also tries to portray him as super strong, which I don\\'t totally buy. He\\'s a big guy, but not that big. He looks like he thinks he\\'s bigger than he is. Compared to the monster that is The Rock, he looks like a skinny twig for Petes sake. And he, Vin Diesel, is lifting cars and tossing people several yards, I just don\\'t buy it.\\n\\nAlso there\\'s some other stuff that I didn\\'t like. There\\'s this \"computer chip\" with some insane technology, and it seemed a little out of place. That stuff was straight up sci/fi. I hate when they mix sci/fi-stuff into action movies that are set today. The plot has some issues, but I choose not to care too much.\\n\\nOK, got that out of the way. This movies has perfectly shot, exciting, over the top-action. Several big, long action scenes, and I pretty much loved all of them. And since this is an action movie first and foremost, I won\\'t let the negative stuff count all that much. I was very entertained.\\n\\nThere are a couple of \\'jump-out-of-a-car-in-slow-motion, at-the-last-millisecond, with-a-one-in-a-billion-chance-of-making-it\\'- scenes that for some reason gives me goosebumps a little. Probably because they are so over the top. I love that stuff. I think of who ever came up with something so over-the-top, and get a little impressed. Good job!\\n\\nGood thinking getting Jason Statham into this, I so rooted for him. He is way cooler than the whole furious-team.\\n\\nAnd that Nathalie Emmanuel, holy gasoline fumes is she gorgeous. And she speaks nineteen languages, including Dothraki, what a catch!\\n\\nAnd of course, we all know Paul Walker is no longer with us, and you\\'re reminded of that each time he is on screen. He gets a little montage at the end, it is very well done - really sad, man. Real damn sad.'}\n",

      "{'ratings': '8/10', 'title': 'Amazing action and decent storyline! 8/10', 'movie_id': '2820852', 'author': 'leonblackwood13', 'date': 'September 2015', 'content': 'Review: WOW! What an epic action extravaganza! This movie was shockingly brilliant because of the unique stunts and decent storyline. Don\\'t get me wrong, it is extremely corny in parts and the one-liners are pretty awful but the action scenes were out of this world. Anyway, the movie is about an assassin (Jason Statham) who is looking to take out the Fast & Furious team because they put his brother in a critically ill state in the previous movie in this franchise. After losing one of there team members to the assassin near the end of the sixth movie, they soon realise that there life\\'s are in danger after a bomb explodes outside Paul Walkers family home. Dwayne Johnson also crosses the assassin in his office were he was looking for the names of the people who put his brother in hospital but the assassin came prepared and ended up hospitalizing the Rock, which put him out of action for most of this movie. This is when Kurt Russell enters the movie and offers Diesel a deal to take out the assassin who is ruining everyone\\'s life\\'s. The deal is to retrieve a unique tracking piece of technology from some terrorists, so they can track Statham down and take him out. The only problem is that the device is under high security so the team put a plan together which sends them around the world. The storyline was very well put together and the directors attention to detail was great. The amazing cars and stunts made this movie the 5th biggest movie of all time and I must admit, it is well deserved. You can definitely tell were the budget went whilst watching the film, especially when there in Abu Dhabi, crashing through buildings and blowing up expensive cars and the fighting scenes were truly a joy to watch. The ending nearly brought a tear to my eye because of the tribute to Paul Walker who died whilst making the movie but the director cleverly used all of the footage that he had of Walker so it seems like he\\'s in the film from the beginning to the end. Anyway, this has to be one of the best films that I have seen this year because of the amazing action scenes and the great cast. Brilliant!\\n\\nRound-Up: I\\'m very surprised that this movie didn\\'t cost more money to make because of the long action scenes which are put together brilliantly by the young director, James Wan. He was a weird choice to direct this movie because he has mostly worked on horror movies like the Insidious franchise, Saw, the Conjuring, which did scare me, Dead Silence and Death Sentence with Kevin Bacon. He really did bring something fresh to the Fast & Furious franchise which has made it one of biggest films of all time but the sad death of Paul Walker might bring a end to this profitable franchise. Paul Walker, 40, really became a household name after starring in the Fast and Furious movies but he had a couple of big screen successes like Into the Blue, Eight Below, Running Scared, Noel, Takers and Hours but none of these movies really pushed him to stardom. His great chemistry with Vin Diesel made the franchise what it is today, even though he was the quiet one of the bunch but he brought some emotion and the \"Family\" concept to the team which will be truly missed. Vin Diesel, 48, has really cut down his workload recently after starring in the successful Riddick in 2003 and voicing Groot in the Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014 but he hasn\\'t released anything since. He does have another xXx and another Guardians of the Galaxy movie coming out next year some time and he\\'ll be kicking of the Last Witch Hunter franchise this year so he\\'s been keeping himself busy. Anyway, Kurt Russell and Jason Statham were excellent additions to the cast and I much prefer Statham as a baddie. I didn\\'t quite understand what happened to Kurt Russell\\'s character or why the special force team didn\\'t help them towards the end but thats just me being picky. It is rumoured that there is going to be an 8th movie in this franchise, coming out in 2017 but anything can happen between now and then.\\n\\nBudget: $190million Worldwide Gross: $1.5Billion\\n\\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/thrillers about the Fast & Furious team being hunted by a assassin after taking out his brother in the previous movie. 8/10'}\n",

So in France it is called Fast & Furious 7 but I believe it is called Furious Seven in the US. Typical French way of doing things I am afraid.\\n\\nThis movie is probably not for everyone. It is very typical for the latest Fast & Furious movies though. The movie can be summed up by explosions, fast cars, fighting, did I mention explosions, repeat until credits roll. For me it was just what I expected and just what I wanted from this particular movie as well. If you are into fast cars, lots of action and explosive special effects and a bit of male macho talk then this movie will please you just fine.\\n\\nThe gang is back. I have to confess that I like both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson even though they are rather far from Shakespeare material as far as acting goes. For this kind of movie they are perfect though. Unfortunately Dwayne Johnson was absent for a good chunk of the movie. When he came back from his brief presence in the beginning of the movie he did so with a vengeance though. I was actually expecting to dislike \"Mr Nobody\" but I have to say that I quite liked him.\\n\\nDespite the fact that this is a macho action movie there is at least a small kernel of story in there. It is a classical revenge story but it is embellished with enough material to make it fairly decent. Well, decent within the confines of this kind of movie of course. Seen from a reasonable point of view the entire movie is of course totally ludicrous. The stunts are really cool but if you sober up from the adrenaline feast you rather quickly find a lot of the stunts pretty far out. Like jumping between buildings in fancy cars and such like. Even if we skip the most ridiculous scenes there are plenty more to nit-pick about. Like the fact that those old, but cool, American cars that Torretto drives would not have a chance in hell against his more modern adversaries unless possibly if the road was entirely straight. But then, these ridiculous things are what the fast and furious series is all about is it not? Well, after about two hours of ludicrous, but very entertaining, actions stunts there is a happy ending and when the credits roll this viewer is definitely a happy customer.'}\n",

But first, the Team must find and protect Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) a master Hacker/Programmer, who created God\\'s Eye, a program that can locate anyone anywhere on the planet. Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), the head of Black Ops, says Ramsey must be found if Dominic wants his help with Shaw.\\n\\nThis should be watched for the stunts and CGI as both are terrific. We will see cars race down a mountain side with many trees in the way; and also see a car jump from one hi-rise building in Dubai into another hi-rise building. These stunts or CGI (who can tell anymore) will take your breath away.\\n\\nThe pacing is very good for these stunts and CGI, but when Dominic and Shaw did hand-to-hand combat it went on forever. The scene would cut away often to the Team in cars trying to avoid the helicopter intent on taking them out with missiles, then revert back to these two who were still at it. Did I mention \"still\" at it. Yes, way too long.\\n\\nThe real winners in here are, of course, the stunts and CGI because they were terrific. And mention must be made for the photography, editing and cinematography as they were spot on.\\n\\nNotables: Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs, Michelle Rodrigues as Letty, Lucacris as Tej, Jordana Brewster as Mia, Tyrese Gibson as Roman, Lucas Black as Sean, and Ronda Rousey the Champion MMA fighter. You will see Rhonda as Kara in a white dress fighting Letty. (a cat fight?) And certainly Paul Walker (Brian) who died in a car crash (he was not driving) during the filming of Furious 7. The song \"See you Again\" that played in the movie was a tribute to Paul Walker.\\n\\nAll in all this was terrific and the action never dragged or went on for too long as scene changes helped that out a lot.

Now, while this should certainly be a possible cause for concern to any normal person, the fact of the matter is that Deckard is a highly trained and extremely skilled professional assassin who has a terrorist organization at his disposal to help him out. Fortunately, Dominic also has some resources of his own with \"Luke Hobbs\" (Dwayne Johnson) and a shadowy government official who calls himself \"Mr. Nobody\" (Kurt Russell) who have separate agendas which coincide with Dominic\\'s plans to kill Deckard before he can kill them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this picture definitely had the talent to be a very fine film. Unfortunately, the director (James Wan) resorted to one preposterous stunt after another which made this film look rather ridiculous in my opinion. Having said that, those who are fans of this particular franchise will probably love this movie for the simple fact that it has plenty of action and some of their favorite actors. Unfortunately, the complete lack of realism severely damaged its credibility in my eyes and I have rated it accordingly. Below average.\\n19 out of 23 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

      "{'ratings': '8/10', 'title': \"An over-blown action film that continues to build on the franchise's success.\", 'movie_id': '2820852', 'author': 'estebangonzalez102', 'date': 'April 2015', 'content': '\"This time it ain\\'t just about being fast.\"\\n\\nJames Wan, who is well known for directing horror films (The Conjuring and Saw), took over the seventh film in this franchise replacing Justin Lin who had been sitting on the director\\'s chair since the third installment. What I found most interesting about this franchise is that it didn\\'t seem like it was going anywhere after its solid debut in 2001 since the first couple of sequels focused on different characters and story lines. Even when they got the entire cast back together in 2009 for the fourth film I didn\\'t feel like it was anything special. I\\'d always mildly enjoyed the films, but it wasn\\'t until Fast Five that I was really engaged with the series. Justin Lin may have not impressed me before, but when that film came out he decided to have fun with the overblown action scenes and audiences embraced it completely. We had the team reuniting together being chased by tanks and planes and pulling off nearly mission impossible tasks. My greatest concern for this film was that Wan wouldn\\'t follow that basic formula that had elevated the franchise in the first place. But in an early scene in the film those fears were soon gone when Wan practically gives the audience a wink by having Brian (Walker) telling his son that \"cars don\\'t fly\" when he playfully throws a small toy car through the window. We were about to find out that that claim wasn\\'t necessarily true because throughout this film we actually see several cars fly during the spectacular action scenes.\\n\\nBy the end of Furious Six the franchise was tied perfectly together by uniting the events that took place in Tokyo during the third film with the present. In the fifth and sixth installments Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), Tej (Ludacirs), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) had finally found financial stability and cleaned their names to return home. The character of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) had helped reinvigorate the franchise and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was brought back from the dead (well actually she never really died, but fans of the franchise know what I mean). Mia (Jordan Brewster) and Brian were enjoying their newfound family life, but as we found out in the end of the sixth film, Owen\\'s brother Deckard (Jason Statham) was set on avenging him. Their seemingly peaceful life is interrupted as the team begins to be hunted down by this dangerous British criminal. Loretto is offered the opportunity to flip the papers on Deckard from being hunted to becoming the hunters when a secret government official known as Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) offers him a deal. A Somalian mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) has kidnapped a hacker known as Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has developed a computer program known as God\\'s Eye that basically allows you to find anyone across the globe in a matter of seconds. If Toretto\\'s team can rescue Ramsey and retrieve God\\'s Eye he will let them use it to track down Deckard and catch him off guard. And so the adventure across the globe begins with flying cars, helicopters and droids exploding across the mountains of the Middle East, the elegant buildings in Abu Dhabi, and the city of Los Angeles.\\n\\nGisele and Han were part of the reason why I enjoyed the previous films so much so I was worried that their absence in this film would hurt the movie, but the addition of Jason Statham as the main villain of the film elevated this to a higher level. There are great fight scenes between him and Dwayne Johnson and then with Vin Diesel that were incredibly entertaining. These are probably the best action stars of our generation and when the fighting choreography is filmed correctly you can\\'t go wrong with these guys. There are also some fantastic action scenes involving fast car chases across a gorgeous mountain that ends in a Jurassic Park like cliffhanger. The action scenes are overblown, but that is what makes them so entertaining once you learn to accept the absurdity of it all and simply enjoy the ride. Over-the-top action scenes is what elevated this franchise in the first place and Furious 7 continues to play with that same premise taking advantage of Wan\\'s knowledgeable work behind the camera and his use of different camera angles which makes the film look all the more entertaining.\\n\\nThe greatest success of Furious 7 is being able to blend the incredibly fun action scenes with the dramatic elements involving the chemistry between the characters. We\\'ve grown to love these characters and each new addition always seems to work. Furious 7 takes some common themes from films like Mission Impossible or Ocean\\'s Eleven and applies them really well here. Tyrese Gibson plays a similar character to the one Matt Damon played in Ocean\\'s where he wants to prove his leadership qualities to the rest of the crew. There are elements recycled from other action films, but thanks to the cast it works extremely well in this franchise. And then you have the emotional aspect of this film surrounding Paul Walker\\'s untimely death. You can\\'t help but feel emotionally engaged towards his character knowing that the actor has recently passed away. There are several scenes of his face where the CGI seems evident, but the voice work was perfectly executed. The CGI never distracted me however, and I\\'m glad they decided to continue with the production of the film. The last five minutes are emotionally engaging and without spoiling the film all I can say is that the crew did him justice with a beautiful tribute. Furious 7 continues to build on an already engrossing franchise and it might just be my second favorite after Fast Five.\\n\\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/'}\n",

But this peace will be shattered when one of their own is killed by the target cross-eye of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is avenging his brother's demise.\\n\\nJames Wan may be known for his contributions to horror-thriller genre (Insidious, The Conjuring, Saw and Death Sentence) but his direction and view of an action genre film is indeed an strong impression that left me and audiences in excitement. Wan proves that action is driven on speed, choreography and style and this makes F&F7 a worthy example of this. The action sequences are all big, loud and pack plenty of eye candy for action fans; from a rescue mission on a moving bus, building jumping, shootouts, fistfights and an explosive climax that takes place in an urban city. Practical stunts, assisting CGI and well-choreographed eye on detail make F&F7 worthy contender for visual effects and stunt awards in the coming year.\\n\\nCasting as always is close and fun in the F&F series, with Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, Gibson, Bridges, Brewster and Johnson sharing the leading formula that makes their characters seem so likable, with Johnson, Russell, Hounsou, Emmanuel and Statham proving great supporting roles. But sadly here it is final acting appearance of the late Paul Walker (who had died in an unexpected event) which left the film in a stand-still and its cast and fans worldwide in deep sadness. The film was delayed for a year and a half but the result was something that would touch not only the audience but its crew and cast. The final scene indeed left people crying in the theater but it was a touching and emotionally connected moment that hasn't been seen in film in some years, it made me feel both sad and touched and feeling that the F&F series had ended perfectly as it won't be the same without Walker.\\n\\nFast & Furious 7 is not only a fast driven action ride but in terms of quality, production value and emotion it proves to be the best of the series and one of this year's best films to have seen. It's only a thought now to see how Mad Max: Fury Road (releasing on May 14th 2015) will overthrow the action and car stunts that F&F7 has established a strong impression among audiences, but regardless this film will indeed be on your to 'see list'.

      "{'ratings': '9/10', 'title': 'A thrilling ride, definitely not the last one', 'movie_id': '2820852', 'author': 'kunalkhandwala21', 'date': 'April 2015', 'content': 'The speedy band of outlaws have surfaced unscathed from impossible missions around the world with varying motives behind each outing. While financial security and independence drove them through streets of Brazil in \\'Fast Five\\', the desperate need to secure amnesty sent them flying across the highways of Spain in \\'6\\'. But this time, things get more personal. For the villain, it\\'s all about retribution and for Dominic Torreto, it\\'s about keeping the familia safe together. For a franchise that set a disclaimer long ago to leave brains behind in lieu of horsepowers, it does pretty well to align the stories through 7 movies and yet keep the team intact for the most part. Dom\\'s position as the alpha hasn\\'t been more at the forefront than it is now. \"This time it ain\\'t just about being fast\". \\'Furious 7\\' promises bigger, better action as muscles of both cars and humans collide to cause destruction. James Wan (\\'Saw\\', \\'Insidious\\', \\'Conjuring\\') is serious about taking crazy to a whole new level when it comes to the action.\\n\\nAfter looking at the plight of his incarcerated brother Owen, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) swears to avenge him by taking down Dominic and his team. During an information extracting break-in at Hobbs\\' (Dwayne Johnson) office, Shaw confronts the DSS agent and sends him flying out of the window straight to a hospital bed. Then, Shaw calls Dom from Japan, just as he has killed Han and threatens to take him down next. An explosion rips apart the Torreto house, with Mia (Jordana Brewster), Brian (Paul Walker) and Dom narrowly escaping. After learning from Hobbs about how deadly Shaw can be, Dom retrieves Han\\'s body from Japan to perform his funeral back home. A suspicious looking car draws Dom\\'s attention who chases it, leading to a head on collision between the two. At this point, Frank Petty and his covert ops team arrive and assure Dom that it would be easy for them to hand over Shaw to him anytime. However, Dom would have to perform a mission impossible for the US Government. It involved extracting a hacker named Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) from the convoy of Mercenary Jackande by air-dropping onto a restricted highway in the Caucasus mountains. This bit of action is the highlight of the film.\\n\\nRamsey created a computer program called God\\'s eye that can use every digital device to track people anywhere. The flash drive containing the program has been sold to a Jordanian Prince in Abu Dhabi who has it hidden in his Lykan hypersport supercar. What follows is something you should only watch on the big screen with popcorn. With God\\'s eye then falling into Jackande\\'s hands again, the finale takes us back to home turf with some exemplary stunts, some raw action between Shaw and Dom and God\\'s eye chasing Ramsey in cars that zip through LA\\'s streets. All this mayhem however, ends with the film\\'s most important subject that must\\'ve been the hardest for the film-makers to deal with. The manner in which they brought closure to Paul Walker\\'s Brian O\\'Conner is heart- warming, elegant and fitting as it says a passive yet emphatic goodbye to one of the familia. Wiz Khalifa\\'s tribute is already a chartbuster and the sequence with montages from previous films honors the legacy of Walker.\\n\\nVin Diesel may not have the acting skills that would enable him to be anyone but Dominic Torreto effectively. But with so many successful films in one franchise, he may not need the alternatives. He is truly the alpha of this series and here, he proves it yet again in the fight sequences with Statham. As bad-ass as he can be, he\\'s still very affable when he stands by his values for his family. In the last ride sequence, it shows that he genuinely lost a brother. Dwayne Johnson has a brief role but when he\\'s on, he is on! Michelle Rodriguez really takes the alpha role seriously too especially with her fight sequences in the Etihad towers. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous are hilarious together while Jason Statham is well, Jason Statham.\\n\\nBut the finest performance has been delivered by WETA digital (yet again), in the motion capture and re-imaging of Paul Walker\\'s prior appearances onto his brothers who acted as body-doubles. The transition is so remarkable that it\\'s virtually impossible to point out the digitalized scenes containing WETA\\'s Walker. Technology has advanced way beyond the CGI in the car chases and action sequences that make up the rest of the film and \\'Furious 7\\' has one of its finest accomplishments.\\n\\nThe entire sequence in Azerbaijan is thrilling and gutsy. From Dom\\'s escape down the hill to the on-the-edge bus scene that has us gazing at the screen in disbelief. Abu Dhabi\\'s flying car scene is ridiculous but nevertheless, exciting because they push those limits too. Finally, the stunts and explosions in LA are no doubt, innovative. The film-makers claim to have used real stunts in most of the action sequences and minimized the role of CGI which is commendable, given the grand scale of destruction and mayhem.\\n\\nIn spite of all its obvious flaws in story-telling and character development, \\'Furious 7\\' is an awesome entertainer. By now, one should expect the limits of practicality to be tested in this series and simply embrace the thrilling ride. As Dom\\'s beloved \\'69 Dodge Charger roars against Shaw\\'s refined yet ferocious Aston Martin DB9, the sounds of engine revs and tyre burns block out all the shortfalls as adrenaline starts pumping again for mayhem. Not surprisingly, this series has us invested in the familia. The freedom they value, the honor they stand for and the thrill they seek on the streets. The lump in the throat effect that the last ride has, is a testament to that very notion.'}\n",

Everything is bigger. The action scenes are bigger, the car scenes are even faster, and of course, \"The Rock\" is bigger. Furious 7 was already highly anticipated, and then tragedy struck, Paul Walker was killed in a car crash when filming. He will always be sorely missed and no one can ever take his place. Even though some of the dialogue and action might be a little cheesy, with great action and car sequences, Paul Walker got the send off he deserved in the series he dedicated his life to.\\n\\nWhat I mean by cheesy dialogue is primarily applied to \"The Rock\\'s\" lines in the movie. He still has a supporting role but it is not nearly as big as his role in the previous two films. To put it simply, his entire dialogue is a series of one-liners to show how big of a badass he is if for some reason you can\\'t already tell. It is amusing still, but it gets slightly irritating after a while. Once he takes out a few helicopters single handedly, you forget those lines and just laugh and love the enormous action taking place. The trailer also clearly shows Jason Stathom who plays Deckard Shaw in this installment as the main villain, but he really is only sprinkled throughout the plot. He never really gets the same screen time Luke Evans, who played Owen Shaw, in the previous installment got. Nevertheless, in the screen time he gets, he acts like the ultimate badass that he is and we can\\'t ask for anything more.\\n\\nThe action and car scenes speak for themselves. In some of the tallest buildings in the world, we see Vin Diesel and Paul Walker practically fly a car straight through three of them and you can\\'t ask for more than that. Sure, it might be outlandishly crazy but everyone should know walking into this movie that it is a hardcore action-car film, not an art film. The fight scenes are also pretty well done. Seeing Vin Diesel and Jason Statham going in a slow-mo glorifying fight to the end shot is incredibly funny and widely entertaining at the same time.\\n\\nThe acting is what we have come to expect from each cast member. They all own their roles. They are their characters at this point. Sure, some may not consider it \"real\" acting but the actors did their part for the movie and you can\\'t ask for anything more. Also, as I said earlier, Paul Walker\\'s send off really was tremendous and many of the audience members might actually find themselves tearing up towards the end as we all listen to the song \"See You Again,\" which I think might be nominated for an Oscar for best original song.\\n\\nIf you just want pure-thrilling entertainment with some laughs thrown in here and there, you should definitely see Furious 7. Since this is a movie where it is a hundred times better on the big screen, I recommend you see Furious 7 in theaters.\\n\\nFor more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com'}\n",

What makes this movie stand out from its predecessors is how it goes beyond the modding of Japanese street cars to engaging the viewer with a very decent storyline that pulls together all of the previous movies. I particularly liked the use of the cut-scenes from previous films that reminded viewers of the continuity of one helluva story.\\n\\nOf course, the other side of going to see this movie was knowing the loss of its prime star - Paul Walker - to a shocking car accident last year, and wondering how much of a role he would play in the film and how well they would work their CGI magic into his role. Needless to say, it was very well done (even though you could tell when they did use CGI of his face in a few scenes).\\n\\nNot trying to give anything away, but the final 5 minutes was a fitting send off for Paul.

With this anticipated seventh installment, they have pulled out the big guns on action, fun and surprisingly emotion as the series reaches new heights and its trademarks that make it recognized.\\n\\nThe film lifts off where the previous 6th outing left, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and crew are home in America having securing their amnesties and living their lives in peace with loved ones: with Toretto still helping his love Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) regain her memories and O'Connor adjusting to fatherhood to his growing son. But this peace will be shattered when one of their own is killed by the target cross-eye of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is avenging his brother's demise.\\n\\nJames Wan may be known for his contributions to horror-thriller genre (Insidious, The Conjuring, Saw and Death Sentence) but his direction and view of an action genre film is indeed an strong impression that left me and audiences in excitement. Wan proves that action is driven on speed, choreography and style and this makes F&F7 a worthy example of this. The action sequences are all big, loud and pack plenty of eye candy for action fans; from a rescue mission on a moving bus, building jumping, shootouts, fistfights and an explosive climax that takes place in an urban city.

Fast cars, mega destruction, brutal fistfights and big guns make it seem an action lover's wet dream\\n\\n+ Improvement on plot, using the trademark franchise style that has overtaken since the 4th installment) and this story line is need more exciting and entertaining than any of the previous films\\n\\n+ The final tribute to Paul Walker was touching, moving and something that makes the series end on a beautiful note\\n\\nOVERALL: Fast & Furious 7 is not only a fast driven action ride but in terms of quality, production value and emotion it proves to be the best of the series and one of this year's best films to have seen.

It was an intensely thrilling action packed joy ride and I had a really great time watching Furious 7.\\n\\nFirstly, I will admit that there were some moments in the film that I felt were a little out of place sort of. Although those moments didn\\'t exactly drop the film in a way, they were just a little unrealistic. I also thought that they could\\'ve used Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson a lot more in this movie since he only had about 10 minutes of screen time, if not less.\\n\\nThat all aside, this was classic explosive Fast & Furious car action. Vin Diesel was amazing in this movie; this time around he plays a more dramatic role since this movie pays a tribute to recently deceased star of the franchise, Paul Walker, making this movie more of a drama than a thriller action film, which I think does it\\'s job really really well at that. I\\'ll admit, I was tearing up at that point.\\n\\nJason Statham also kills it in this movie. I\\'ve admired his acting skills, but I think this is the movie that I am going to remember him from the most out of every movie he\\'s done. He is a good actor, but as the main villain in this movie, Deckard Shaw, I thought he delivered the most.\\n\\nOverall, I had a blast with Fast & Furious 7, it was exciting and emotional, it made us all laugh and cry. I have listened to that song by Charlie Puth and Wiz Khalifa \"See You Again\" so many times, I love that song, it\\'s a perfect way to carry the film\\'s emotional tribute to Paul Walker and to give him the perfect send-off.\\n\\nFor Paul 9.9/10'}\n",

      "\"Minions\" is a lot of fun and a great family movie, but may be too much of a good thing.\n",
      "{'ratings': '7/10', 'title': '\"Minions\" is a lot of fun and a great family movie, but may be too much of a good thing.', 'movie_id': '2293640', 'author': 'CleveMan6610', 'date': 'July 2015', 'content': 'In 2010, Illumination Entertainment released its first animated feature film, \"Despicable Me\", about an evil genius named Gru who was struggling to stay on top of the evil genius business, with the help of his pint-sized henchmen known as minions. That film made over $250 million in the U.S. alone (almost quadruple what it cost), so, naturally, there was a sequel. In 2013, \"Despicable Me 2\" made over $368 million domestically and was rated by audiences as even better than the original. The minions were a small big reason for all that. They were a hit in the first film and they played a larger role in the second film, which performed even better than the first, so, naturally, they got a movie of their own.\\n\\nThe minions are child-sized, yellow, pill-shaped creatures whose sole purpose in life is to serve an evil master. Some are a little taller than the others, they have slightly different styles of (sparse) hair, some have two eyes and some have one, but all wear goggles and they speak in a kind of child-like babble which combines English, Spanish, French and possibly bits of a few other languages too (it\\'s kind of hard to tell). Oh, and one more thing – they\\'re simply and completely ADORABLE! In spite of their evil inclinations, these are simple-minded, child-like innocents who mainly want to have fun and fulfill their potential as minions. And they are front and center in \"Minions\" (PG, 1:31).\\n\\nThis sequel to the \"Despicable Me\" movies is really a spin-off and also a prequel, which takes us back to the beginning of the minions\\' story – ALL the way back. We see how the minions originated and, through a short series of vignettes, we observe their well-meaning, but hilariously botched attempts to serve a wide variety of ill-tempered masters throughout history. Finally, they are driven into exile in an ice cave in Antarctica. They build a civilization and do their best to entertain themselves, but without a master to serve, they\\'re unbearably bored. So, in 1968, Kevin (voiced by co-director Pierre Coffin, who does all minion voices), a tall(ish) minion, tells his tribe he\\'s going on a quest to find them a new master. With only the extremely child-like minion (even by minion standards) named Bob, and a \"volunteer\" named Stuart to help, Kevin begins his journey.\\n\\nThe three minions end up at Villain Con, a secret convention of super villains and their fans, where the minions meet and get hired by Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), the first female supervillain. Scarlet is taking her typical girlish fantasy of being a princess a little too seriously. She wants her newly-hired helpers to steal the British crown jewels so she can be Queen of England. Scarlet\\'s husband, Herb (John Hamm) sets up Kevin, Stuart and Bob with a variety of his evil inventions and they embark on their mission. Of course, this being the minions, nothing goes according to plan, one thing leads to another, Scarlet feels as if the minions have betrayed her, and she sets out to get revenge on Kevin, Stuart and Bob, while still trying to accomplishing her goal. Meanwhile, the rest of the minions have received word that Kevin has found them a new master in the U.K. and the entire tribe is working to get there ASAP.\\n\\n\"Minions\" has a slightly different target audience than the \"Despicable Me\" films and feels like a little too much of a good thing. Don\\'t get me wrong – I LOVE me some minions, but they\\'re schtick can wear thin. Even their powerful minion cuteness can\\'t sustain an entire film. Plus, while the \"Despicable Me\" movies seemed to appeal nearly equally to kids, teens and adults, the minions\\' spin-off is more squarely aimed at kids. The animation, voice work and story are all as strong as the previous films in which the minions appeared, but the humor in this one aims a little lower. The adults will enjoy the soundtrack and there are plenty of cute, clever, and funny moments. \"Minions\" works well as a family movie, but I think the little yellow guys should stick to being fun, naughty side-kicks. It\\'s what they do best. \"B+\"'}\n",

After failing to keep their masters numerous times, the minions feel without purpose. That's when three brave minions, Kevin, Bob, and Stuart set out on a journey to find their new master. Despicable Me franchise has done a lot of things right, one of which that clicked with all ages were the adorable little minions. This film could've been very basic, continuously rehashing a collection slapstick comedy, and just simply depend on the popularity of the minions. Instead, the creators of this film added heart to the characters, delivering a movie that kids will love and adults will have fun with.\\n\\nFull Review:\\n\\nAs much as I love the minions in the Despicable Me movies, I was quite pessimistic on how good Minions was going to be. It just felt like a cash grab. Of course, all movies aim to grab some cash but this movie in particular felt like the studio was just capitalising on the popularity of the characters. Gratefully, the movie got me to set aside my pessimism.\\n\\nOne of my biggest concerns was whether a collection of side characters can really carry an entire movie. Short answer as it turns out: yes they can. It works because we are focusing on just three minions for the majority of the movie. Each of them have their unique personality that shines through without a single word of comprehensible dialogue. That in itself is an amazing feat, the minion-gibberish is all non-sense and yet I am able to empathise with them. I can't even say the same for actual human actors in other movies sometimes! So in that sense, job well done animators. I also liked the small story arc that was given to the villain of the movie, Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock). She wasn't a villain just for the sake of it, which added another dimension to what could have been a generic character. There is relatable back story to her that made us understand where she was coming from, while still retaining the unpredictable evil-ness.\\n\\nThe movie is not without flaws. There are times where the jokes might be too slapstick for adults to enjoy. These scenes are obviously aimed for the kids. They don't completely alienate us grown-ups but it is still noticeable. On top of that, I have to say I felt the absence of Gru and the kids from the Despicable Me movies. What I love about the minions is their relationship with Gru's family, the pranks, the shenanigans, the care they have for each other, is all so delightful to watch. This absence was bound to happen since we are concentrating on the minions. At the same time, aside from Scarlett Overkill there are no other memorable supporting characters.\\n\\nEven with the problems, I really did enjoy my time watching Minions. It was a great light hearted, charming, fun movie. If you have little kids, nephews or nieces, don't hesitate to take them to the cinema. They will have an awesome time. Together you too will find some amusing entertainment.\"}\n",

In a throwback to classic setting and comedy, this spin-off might not be bigger than most animations in recent time, but it's still an enjoyable foray. The style of 60s world and era appropriate soundtracks enhance the atmosphere as these peculiar creatures dabble in feeble mischief.\\n\\nStory follows three particular minions on their way to find the most dreadful villain there is. The journey takes them across the globe until they meet Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock). Graphic-wise Minions is presentable. Though not all of the set pieces are magic, some of the displays, such as the rainy night or monarch architecture are still engaging and presented with nifty details.\\n\\nThe mostly simplistic nature works well, bringing visual cues and lots of squeaking mumbles. It doesn't use elaborate word plays, but this is actually an advantage as the humor is readily accessible for any casual viewer. Several of the jokes are distinctly amusing, though it doesn't fall flat even when a couple of them don't hit the high note.\\n\\nIt also boasts notable pop references of the time, from the ironic quips and its zippy tunes. The human characters can be a bit stereotypical or over-the-top, since these are mostly spoof version of action flick baddies. Its actual villain portrayal might take the name Overkill way too seriously for comical purpose.\\n\\nThe presentation for visual humor is fine and the references are easily relatable.

      "{'ratings': '7/10', 'title': \"Not as heartwarming as the Despicable Me films but, it's hilarious!\", 'movie_id': '2293640', 'author': 'Anurag-Shetty10', 'date': 'July 2015', 'content': \"Minions is a movie that tells the origin story of the cute, yellow, goggle wearing creatures that gained massive popularity in Despicable Me(2010) & Despicable Me 2(2013). The Minions(Pierre Coffin) have been on Earth, far longer than humans have. They have only one purpose. Find the baddest & most despicable super-villain of all time. Their journey to find the baddest boss takes them on a long & tumultuous adventure. Finding a boss wasn't difficult. However, keeping a boss turned out to be particularly hard due to one hilarious mishap after another. Finally, three Minions namely, Kevin, Stuart & Bob take the initiative to make sure all the Minions have the most evil & despicable boss to work for. This leads the trio to, Scarlett Overkill(Sandra Bullock). Scarlett has nefarious plans to take over the world, with the help of Kevin, Stuart & Bob.\\n\\nMinions is an extremely funny movie. This is thanks to the goofy antics of the adorable titular characters. I loved the idea of a Villain Con. This film had me guffawing throughout its run-time. However, it lacks the heart & emotional depth of the Despicable Me movies. Characters like, Gru, Margo, Edith & Agnes are missed. Don't worry though. The Minions, with their mildly understandable gibberish & various idiosyncrasies will make this film thoroughly enjoyable for the whole family. Though most of the gags involving the Minions get repetitive, it still manages to crack you up, every single time. The animation & 3D are fantastic. Sandra Bullock is brilliant as Scarlett Overkill. Jon Hamm is amazing as Herb Overkill. Michael Keaton is spectacular as Walter Nelson. Allison Janney is awesome as Madge Nelson. Steve Coogan is good as Professor Flux/Tower Guard. Jennifer Saunders is outstanding as The Queen. Geoffrey Rush is great as the Narrator. I loved Steve Carell's cameo as Young Gru. Last but not the least, Pierre Coffin steals the show as The Minions. A must watch for all fans of the Despicable Me franchise.\"}\n",

So as you see, I have a personal affiliation with the minions. I really enjoyed this.\\n\\nThe story is simple but not boring or over-exaggerated. There are many little happenings throughout the film that add to the atmosphere and overall mood of the film. Choosing to focus on three minions (though I miss Dave) was a good call. The three different personalities – not to mention shape size – of these minions were so prominent and well established that instead of being 'minions' they were Kevin, Stuart and Bob. Kevin being the older brother, Stuart the rock star and Bob the most lovable.\\n\\nThe animation was great with good effects and colours that matched the theme of the film. However, I do have to disagree with the extreme body sizes of some characters. Most have too tall and skinny bodies; Walter Nelson (Michael Keaton) and Herb Overkill (Jon Hamm) both look like a human version of 'Daddy long legs'. I guess however, that this adds to the impossibility element of the film.\\n\\nThe voice acting was pretty awesome. I love Sandra Bullock, and she did great here, I almost couldn't recognize her voice in some places. She gave great energy to her character, as did Jon Hamm and Michael Keaton. I did not recognize Jennifer Saunders as The Queen, but it did sound familiar, and she was funny. But obviously the spotlight goes to Pierre Coffin and his marvellous gibberish minions talk. There is notably a lot of Spanish words and phrases in the minions speech in addition to many other languages that seem to just fit in randomly here and there. I was pleasantly shocked to hear Bob say 'Terima Kasih' which means thank you in Malay. Mad props to Coffin, to be able to voice the minions in a way that can be distinguishable between the three main characters.\\n\\nMaybe the reason I like this so much is because there is less obvious talking and more inferencing of what the minions are talking about. Because even though we do not understand them in the literal sense, we can still infer as to what they are referring to.\\n\\nThis movie is more about having fun than anything else and I enjoyed it thoroughly.\\n\\nRead more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com\"}\n",

Despite people's love for these characters, it seemed like a big risk to give the minions their own solo movie, mainly for the fact that they can't speak, but it worked out very well and is probably one of the most impressive spin off movies to date, something Hiollywood have gotten right on very few occasions. The characters are very lovable and we genuinely care for and support them in their journey. It suffers from the same problem a lot of these animated spin offs have (Penguins of Madagascar, Puss in Boots, etc.), it dosen't have as much heart as the movies it is spun off from have, no scenes that warm us and make us feel sympathetic towards the characters to the same degree we do for Gru and his daughters, this is something I think should always be evident in animated films and it is a huge loss when it isn't. The voice cast is outstanding and certainly the highlight of the movie, Peter Coffin is obviously superb as every single minion, and there are also great performances from the likes of Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton, Allison Janney and Geoffrey Rush, who all sounded like they really enjoyed delivering these characters dialogue and wern't just in it for the pay check. It's certainly not perfect, but Minions is definitely a very fun and enjoyable ride that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good family film.\\n\\nAfter searching for someone to serve, the Minions become recruits for Scarlet Overkill, who hatches a plan to take over England, and eventually the world.\"}\n",

The main minions in the film Kevin, Bob and Stuart were fairly funny at times, and the fact that they couldn't speak English added another funny mark to it. If you have seen the Despicable Me franchise, then you probably know who the minions are, but if you haven't seen the Despicable Me franchise, then before you watch Minions, I recommend you see Despicable Me 1 and 2, As that is where they were first introduced to the world. Moving on, some villains in the film, seemed a bit rushed just to get on with the movie, and some of them were unnecessary, but overall they each had their own funny scenes. The main villain Scarlett Overkill, had a crazy personality, and had some good humor which added a nice ring to the film, as well as that the Minions were always there to mess with her, So it was an action packed- family fun film :)\\n\\nOverall: I recommend you watch this, it has some funny moments and is a perfect spin-off to the Despicable Me franchise.

Finally (and unsurprisingly) getting their own movie, this prequel begins with a clever montage charting the evolution of the eponymous critters as they follow one doomed boss after the other. Settling in to the 1960's for the bulk of the adventure, this whimsical comedy focuses on three brave minions who journey to Orlando – for a villains-convention of course – then London, in search of another boss. Not all the jokes work and chief new addition Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) lives up to her name in the worst possible sense, but the gag rate is so high there is still a healthy dose of laughs. The trademark minion chatter has evolved with an increase in recognisable words but remains just as amusing, whilst the cheeky visual gags and hidden references ensure there's humour for all ages. Where this film differentiates itself from the Despicable flicks though, is by homing in on, and adding depth to, a specific trio of minions: optimistic leader Kevin, laidback crooner Stuart and the indefatigable ball of joy Bob. Another bonus for the parents in the crowd is the ridiculously good soundtrack featuring classics from The Beatles, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, The Turtles, The Kinks, Aerosmith and The Who, to list but a few. More of a carefree, in-the-moment joyride rather than an animated heavyweight with lasting power, Minions is a bundle of silly fun.\"}\n",

Caught in variations of the same scenarios, the decision to put more focus on the three minions - Kevin, Stuart and Bob might remind audiences about Alvin and the Chipmunks or the three daughters of Gru. While the animation does remain the fun, hilarious and ridiculous behaviors of the characters, the theme of the scores and the nonsensical language of the minions, it does not have a strong villain to support the three, also it lacks of character development, warm emotional engagement and moral values. The cuteness of the minions is the main element for entertainment rather than the dialogue itself in which the jokes aren't as funny as Despicable Me's series. Nonetheless, it is still energetic, actions packed, visually stunning and colorful for family audiences even its creative mistake drags its overall quality, proving that these banana lovers are far more effective and surprising to be supporting characters just as in the main franchise.\\n49 out of 84 found this helpful.

      "{'ratings': '7/10', 'title': 'Cute, Minion Fun, Lacking A Lot Of Other Elements', 'movie_id': '2293640', 'author': 'rgkarim11', 'date': 'July 2015', 'content': \"We've all had moments where we speak gibberish, but none of us match the skill level of babbling utter nonsense like the Minions of Despicable Me. The cute, cuddly, yellow bodied blobs have entertained for the past few years with their antics, communicating in their special language that remains undecipherable to me this day. Turns out they are so popular Hollywood has decided to give them their own movie, one that is sure to provide hours of fun for all ages alike. So with all the advertisement and hype, you may be wondering what this movie has in store. Fortunately I am here to help, so sit back and read the latest review.\\n\\nIf I were to summarize this movie in one word it would be CUTE. The animation studio has managed to bring all the cuddliness of Gru's henchmen and unleash it tenfold on the screen. Sure there were some adorable moments in Despicable Me movies, but Minions takes it to the next level with squeaky voices, petite faces and huggable goodness. Boys and girls, men and women of all ages will be awing as our three heroes traverse the elements to find their new boss. Bob in particular was the cutest as he jumps into the adventure with eager eyes, and a beat up teddy bear. In truth it is like watching three small children go on an impossible voyage, constantly failing, but doing so in a manner that pulls at your heart strings.\\n\\nMinions is also a very happy and energetic movie, the youthful antics of the minions bringing a positive vibe to the theater that you feed on. The movie is simply fun, the pint sized aspiring villains living life to the fullest as they explore the city. Because of their enhanced biology, or whatever force makes them nearly invincible, the sky is the limit for what troubles they can get into. Normal devices that are meant to be horrifying, or extremely violent have now been diluted to playground level fun, sugar coated with the Minion cuteness to distract from their true meaning. Bombs, guns, bank robbing, etc, it's all just a big game run by naïve munchkins and a world full of extreme personalities that make for very one dimensional characters.\\n\\nSurely you are asking one thing in your mind though, is it funny? The answer is yes, Minions is definitely a humor filled movie targeted for the young and young at heart. Slapstick comedy unfolds as the Minions pull off three stooges ploys as they slap, crush, and blow up everything around them. Their klutziness, and again their versatile bodies, allows reality to be shattered and for them to survive anything. As you can guess the Minions gibberish is also very entertaining, the random babbling made funny in the delivery as they add their voice modifications to the mix. Again Bob has the funniest sounds, as his high pitched squabble makes him my favorite. Voices and slapstick aside, the funniest aspect for me are the built in references to the movie in terms of song and movie numbers. I spent my time trying to figure out what movies the scenes were from, having to rely on my mentor to help fill in some of the details, especially those that were about classic bands or plays. Whatever source you find funny, let it be known that Minions is going to get you chuckling at some point in the film. However\\x85\\n\\nLike everything there is a balance that is greatly needed in its film and the major downfall of this movie is doing too much of one thing. First the gibberish thing, it's nice to get that ridiculous language in spurts like in Despicable Me, but in this movie it took too much focus. A lack of dialog was annoying, the mindless gibberish losing its appeal to me, especially when there was a lack of supporting dialog to relieve us from the antics. The slapstick saved it somewhat, the variety in the comedic situations assisting with keeping things fresh. My friend pointed out that Minion antics are fun in small doses, which this movie abuses. The young and obsessed won't care, but I could have used a better story to ground the adventure a bit. The simplistic tale was also not the most thrilling, the tale very formulaic and lacking in character development. Even the villain Scarlet Overkill didn't hold much strength, and was thrown to the back behind the minions. In addition, about half the movie had been revealed in the six trailers they have shown, especially the fun opening, but the parts that weren't ruined are still entertaining. The limited voice acting is decent, but when all you are doing is babbling like an idiot, there isn't much to really be impressed with, even with the great Sandra Bullock leading the group.\\n\\nMinions is the adventure you are all expecting it to be, a mashup of cute, positive, fun that will have you chuckling most of the way. Chances are if you are obsessed with the little guys in Despicable Me, you are going to find no fault in this movie. However, Minions leaves a lot to be wanted, including story, character development, and some more clever humor that could work with the language. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed myself with a lot of the humor here, but my scores have to entail everything. I recommend a trip to the theater with a group, or taking your young ones, but please don't be persuaded to see the 3-D version.\\n\\nMy scores are: Animation, Comedy, Family: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0\"}\n",

The limitless amount of perfection in this movie blows my mind till this day.\\n\\nI watched this movie on the day it came out, I had my doubts because the first despicable me movies were decent, but as the story progressed i was driven to the edgy of my seat, waiting on the funky little yellow men their next moves. Stuart Kevin and Bob have kept making my day everytime I rewatch this movie, which has been a total of 13 times so far.\\n\\nI love how the movie starts of with showing how the minions came to be, and. It gave me alot more insight into the minion lore, the way these tiny little yellow men cannot properly survive without the most evil and despicable leader to follow to the point they were driven to depression, was something truly remarkable to see. Kevin's braveness to go into to the world and help his fellow minions to find a boss, gives me hope and motivation to this day. I love how Bob and Stuart join him because it truly makes for a quite hilarious trio.\\n\\nI love how we were able to see where they got their adorable little outfits from after they landed in New York. The introduction of the Nelson family was also amusing to watch! But if we're talking about good introductions I think Gru at the end of the movie takes the spotlight.\\n\\nAnd how can I not talk about Scarlet Overkill, she took the place of Vector as my favourite Despicable Me franchise villain. Her introduction!! Amazing!! Choosing Sandra Bullock as her voice actress was a fine choice too, she truly brought the character to life.\\n\\nI will continue to recommend this movie to people around me, as will I continue to enjoy this masterpiece. I cannot wait for the second movie, my calender is already marked!\"}\n",

Also like to love a vast majority of their feature films, my favourites being the 'Toy Story' films, 'Up', 'Coco' and 'Inside Out' and my least favourites being the 'Cars' sequels and 'The Good Dinosaur'.\\n\\nWhile not one of my favourite Pixar films, 'The Incredibles' is still a very, very good film that has gone even higher in my estimations after a well overdue re-watch to get myself prepared for 'Incredibles 2', fantastically animated, exciting, funny, emotionally investable and ground-breaking with great characters. Expectations were high for its long awaited sequel fourteen years on, and while it is not as good a film, and what could and should have been super and incredible wasn't quite, on the most part 'Incredibles 2' was worth the wait.\\n\\n'Incredibles 2' does lack 'The Incredibles' originality (not much new here) and its emotional impact and character development is also not as good, the latter particularly is noticeably thinner (Bob for example was more complex before). It was a little too long for a story as slight as it was, would have trimmed it by 15-20 minutes and tightened the first act's pacing with it taking a bit too much time to get going.\\n\\nLike others, among my biggest problems were to do with the villain. The villain was forgettable (one of Pixar's weakest easily), the twist concerning their identity that was too obvious too soon. Found their plan convoluted, that when explained made me want a re-wind button which was not possible in the cinema, and the motivation was pretty weak and extreme, took a while for me to get my head round. While the characters are fun, it did feel like there were too many, not sure whether it needed that many superheroes that aren't given enough to do other than in the climax.\\n\\nHowever, it may sound like 'Incredibles 2' was a bad film. It wasn't. Actually enjoyed it a good deal. The animation is fantastic, smooth, vibrant in colour and meticulous in background detail, some very striking details, a richly immersive setting and the characters are well designed. Michael Giacchino's score gets one in a rousing mood while also being dynamic with the action. The action is superbly animated and thrilling with real suspense and excitement.\\n\\nWriting has many moments of humour that provides a lot of laughs (Jack Jack steals the show here, especially with his powers and his fight with the racoon, with some nice lines later from Edna), moments that probe thought and drama that's relatable and never too sentimental (if not as poignant as one would like). The story does grip, more so in the Elastigirl story that really held my attention before the villain reveal underwhelmed. The family drama stuff is also very prominent, and while it is repetitive at times and there could have been less of it the best moments are very funny and it is very easy to relate to the dilemmas the characters face. Pacing mostly excites when things get going.\\n\\nCharacter development is nowhere near as strong here and it would have benefitted from less characters and more done with the existing characters and more thought with the villain and their plan/motivations, but the characters are mostly fun with the highlight being Jack Jack. The voice acting is terrific, especially from Holly Hunter, Craig T Nelson and Samuel L Jackson. Brad Bird is a lot of fun in Edna's small role and Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk and Jonathan Banks are good additions.\\n\\nOverall, very enjoyable but wanted to like it much more. 7/10 Bethany Cox\"}\n",

Somehow, for me, the movie just fell flat and didn\\'t please me to anything like the degree of its predecessor.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, the Pixar animation is fantastic as always, but somewhere along the line, the story, characters and humour lack something. The outlawed super-heroes / aliens / mutants theme has been done to death, from the X-Men to the Marvel Civil War right up to the current Supergirl TV series, likewise the husband and wife role-reversal with Mr Incredible\\'s turn as three super-babies and a super-dad again seemed old-hat while Elastigirl\\'s elevation to solo superstardom also felt a little like a forced and belated concession to PC-dom.\\n\\nI\\'m trying now to remember a really funny, laugh-out-loud line or memorable eye-popping sequence and I find I can\\'t.

This is especially true to kids\\' films in recent years an it seems like a bazillion cartoons and CGI movies have been made and remade in a cynical attempt to make money. Are they any good? For most, I\\'d say no. However, I am happy I saw \"Incredibles 2\" as it was worthy of the franchise and offers enough new content to make it worth your time.\\n\\nIn this follow-up, super-heroes have been banned and the Incredibles family is not about to break the law. However, when an eccentric billionaire offers to help the family rehabilitate the image of heroes in an effort to get them unbanned, bad things are in store. It\\'s not that he is evil....but someone around him has an agenda of their own. In the meantime, Mr. Incredible is forced to become a house husband...and he struggles with learning to parent effectively and live without using his super skills. Ultimately, however, the entire family is forced into action to not only save the day but Mrs. Incredible.\\n\\nOf all the recent kids films, I must say that \"Incredibles 2\" has the strongest feminist message. This is NOT a complaint. I liked seeing Mrs. Incredible become the family breadwinner and Mr. Incredible learn to be tender and a caregiver. There are also other feminist aspects of the story...but I\\'ll say no more since it would spoil the plot!\\n\\nOverall, an incredibly well animated and thoroughly enjoyable film. Not exactly original (hence a score that isn\\'t higher), but well worth seeing....unlike the countless \"Ice Age\" sequels and the like.'}\n",

They convince Elastigirl to be the face of the revival while Mr. Incredible has to play Mr. Mom.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, this is fun. It's a solid superhero movie and a fine family adventure. There is one hilarious scene with Jack-Jack and a raccoon. The only misstep is wiping Tony's memories. It would be so much more compelling for Tony to know Violet's secret and have them deal with that. It would make the young romance much more powerful and more dangerous. He could be a damsel in distress or he could slip up with the secret. There are more possibilities with him knowing. I would like Dash to dial back the bratty kid act by a half level.

Catherine Keener is amazing as Evelyn Deavor. Eli Fucile is adorable as Jack-Jack Parr. Bob Odenkirk is awesome as Winston Deavor. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as Lucius Best/Frozone.

This time, they are struggling to regain a good reputation for superheroes (ostracized due to the collateral damage of their heroics) while also getting caught up in fighting a scheme against Screenslaver, a villain who hypnotizes victims with TV screen images.\\n\\nThe idea of Screenslaver seems clever and almost touches on the modern world's collective obsession with technical devices and other forms of media. It doesn't quite get to the heart of the matter and misses an opportunity to be a clever critique of our current times. The theme even seems to be jumbled and incoherent at times.\\n\\nBut overall, the film is saved by funny characters and doing what action-filled, comical, Hollywood blockbusters set out to do: be entertaining.

      "{'ratings': '7/10', 'title': \"Can't Escape the Incredible Legacy of the Original\", 'movie_id': '3606756', 'author': 'ModishMovies14', 'date': 'June 2018', 'content': 'Since I already know you are going to rate this review as \"Not Helpful\" because I didn\\'t rate this 10/10 stars, I figured I might as well start off by telling you how much I love the original Incredibles. The Incredibles (2004) is one of my favorite films of all time and is my second favorite Pixar film (right after Finding Nemo). I got to see Incredibles 2 early because I caught a double feature of the two films in IMAX, just in case you were thinking of complaining that I didn\\'t see it since this review is out early.\\n\\nWhat I loved about the original was the authenticity that the story, characters, and animation had to it. It felt more creative, natural, and beautiful. Syndrome was one of the greatest superhero movie villains of all time, not because of the amount of damage he was able to inflict upon the world, but because of the emotional pain he was able to cause Mr. Incredible and his family. The moments in which Mr. Incredible regrets his past mistakes and realizes how his actions affect others, especially his former biggest fan, are what makes the film stand out from any other hero-villain dynamic. Sadly, Incredibles 2 does not have a villain or story as deep or as thoughtful as Syndrome.\\n\\nIncredibles 2 boldly and intelligently begins right where The Incredibles ended. This smart move on Disney Pixar\\'s part eliminates all confusion and time gaps that may arise after a hiatus of any amount (especially fourteen years) between a sequel and its predecessor. The story that follows is relatively contrived and characters are clumsily introduced in order to expand the universe instead of expanding the emotions of the beloved characters. The action scenes are creative and well-animated, but they aren\\'t memorable enough and take place in bland settings and accomplish nothing for the characters. There were many points during this film where I noticed how hard Brad Bird was trying to replicate the formula of the original film, but it became more and more noticeable to the point that it detracted from the story itself.\\n\\nThe great Pixar films all have excellent, fluid stories. The great Pixar films also have superb plots that deepen our understanding and feelings for the characters. The good Pixar films have entertaining, sensible plots, but they rarely deepen our love of the characters involved in them, such as A Bug\\'s Life, Cars 2 (don\\'t hate me!), Cars 3, and The Good Dinosaur. Incredibles 2, sadly, falls into the latter category that has a fun, creative plot, but a plot that does nothing new for its characters.\\n\\nSince the villain is introduced in the trailer, I don\\'t think that it\\'s a spoiler to say that it doesn\\'t feel authentic or inspired enough to be considered one of Pixar\\'s best villains. While the motive for the villain is there, it is simply unnecessary, contrived, and unexciting. New heroes are also introduced (as seen in the poster and other promotional material). Many of them are underutilized or unnecessary. The film\\'s weakest parts involve the newly introduced characters because they all lack the liveliness and creative spark of the original characters that are explored slightly more deeply in this film.\\n\\nBut enough of the aspects of the film that let me down. For all of the disappointments, Incredibles 2 also has many surprises and amazing qualities. For one, Jack Jack\\'s new abilities are basically perfect, both in what his powers are and in how they are revealed. At first, I worried that too much of Jack Jack\\'s powers were revealed, but that was hardly the case. Jack Jack is actually one of the best parts of this film. He is easily one of the funniest parts of any Pixar film. I couldn\\'t help but burst out in laughter every time he made a single noise. The humor in this film is slightly more present, or maybe more memorable, than in the original. The film\\'s message also tries to be more important and necessary besides highlighting the importance of family.\\n\\nObviously this review won\\'t stop you from seeing this film, nor was it intended to, but I encourage all of you to see this film in theaters, but heavily reduce your expectations and don\\'t think too much about what made The Incredibles nearly perfect, or you are sure to be sorely disappointed.'}\n",

      "{'ratings': '8/10', 'title': 'Predictable, But Perfect', 'movie_id': '3606756', 'author': 'sfgebel3154', 'date': 'July 2018', 'content': 'I cannot believe it has been 14 years since The Incredibles came out. The gap between sequels seems to be getting longer, but the director, Brad Bird, said he wanted to wait until he had the perfect story. There\\'s even a clip before the film starts where actors, Craig T. Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Holly Hunter tell us it will be \"well worth the wait\"--and they were right!\\n\\nThough 14 years later, the film takes place minutes later. The first film ends with the Parr family having to fight the Miner who pops up out of the school parking lot, just after Violet gets a date with Tony. The sequel starts with that fight and we see how it backfires as the Parr family get arrested for destroying part of the city and because superheroes are still illegal. Enter our new characters, siblings Winston and Evelyn Deaver, who both want to help superheroes step back into the light, but they believe the way to do that is with Elastigirl. Therefore, our sequel twist is that Mr. Incredible becomes a stay-at-home dad having to babysit Jack-Jack and learning of his dozens of powers, teaching Dash \"new math\", and inserting his foot into his mouth when he tries to help Violet with her crush--all while Elastigirl is improving superhero relations.\\n\\nPersonally, I thought the movie was predictable but perfect. I loved it for its simplistic plot that was not hard to figure out. I knew right away who the \"villain\" was and what their motivation was; however, I did not know exactly how the climax would occur, so I was still very much engaged. Not to mention there was enough character development and funny scenes to space out the predictable plot arch.\\n\\nOften times animated films are more for the adults who are taking the kids, then for the kids themselves. Most kids will not understand half the references, but will still enjoy the overall concept. At the same time, this film comes out when the kids who saw the first are now adults, possibly with kids of their own. Therefore, this film is a great blend of adult and child humor. I found it hilarious, and as a teacher, I particularly loved when Mr. Incredible stays up all night reading Dash\\'s \"new math\" textbook so he can teach him new math, which was what it was called in the 60s (the time period this film alludes to) and is a shout out to our modern common core confusion.\\n\\nWhat I really love about this film is that there is even more Frozone and Jack-Jack, which brings me to my all-time favorite scenes--learning of Jack-Jack\\'s powers, particularly when Violet and Dash call Uncle Frozone over because their dad is going insane from sleep-deprivation and trying to keep up with Jack-Jack. I lost track of how many powers he has and all I will say on the matter is that the best scene in the whole film is when Jack-Jack fights the raccoon.\\n\\nIf you want a light-hearted comedy with some fun action sequences then this film is for you. If you loved the first one then you will love the second one. If you have not seen the first one, what\\'s wrong with you?'}\n",

Twenty minutes in, we happily realized that the writer/director Brad Bird actually put as much effort into this movie as he did in the original Incredibles.\\n\\nTo echo every other reviewer- it was worth waiting 14 years. I will happily wait another 14 if the third installment is up to the caliber of #2.\\n\\nThe animation is top notch and the script is surprisingly deep- Superheros are struggling to regain their lawful status in society. Violet is going through teenage dating pains. Family finances and stay at home parenting are heavy themes on top of the standard villain vs. Hero struggle.\\n\\nStill, it manages to be laugh out loud funny all the way through. Jack Jack's ability reveals are easily the funniest scenes in the movie, and we love the Poltergeist Easter egg. Wonder if Craig T Nelson had anything to do with it?\\n\\nYes, the main villain is kind of weak and predictable, but that only took one star off. The story did drag at spots, as in the editor could have cut 10 minutes without losing much.\\n\\nLike the original, we will watch it again and again when it comes out on disc.\"}\n",

From the moment the film starts it is enjoyable. Good sense of humour and a lot of nice scenes. A lot of laughable moments. Apart from the film being too short it still met my expectations. As a 39 year old who played all the Mario games since childhood, this bought back a lot of fond memories of sleepless nights of playing the Mario games. A must watch film whether you have kids or not.\\n173 out of 260 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.\\nPermalink\"}\n",

A movie that has all of the elements you'd want represented from Super Mario bros video games, and as a bonus, it also showcases Mario cart and donkey kong junior. The animation is strong, the worlds are exactly like the video games and truly fun moments for kids. The runtime is great and the movie moves along without pause.\\n\\nAND I expect better, higher quality movie making.\\n\\nThe voice acting in this movie is so lazy. Chris Pratt is forgettable-anyone could have done better voicing such a beloved character. Princess Peach is the same - voice acting is boring and fairly emotionless. The worst voice acting belongs to Seth's terrible Donkey Kong junior - not a single attempt to make an actual character voice, just Seth's normal voice slapped on Donkey Kong. Toad's voice acting is also meatless and without any real jokes.\\n\\nThe script is mostly empty and there is little to no attempt at character motivation, organic character decision making - for example, why Princess Peach tells Mario he can come with her to save her kingdom. Almost every opportunity to make a joke is skipped. None of the characters have stated goals aside from King Koppa.\\n\\nAnd saddest of all to me, there is no attempt to create backstory or give context to these beloved worlds and characters.\"}\n",

But with all that said, it does mess up its flow with some of the music. Definitely not the original score though, since it mixes the classic music with an epic and emotional tone.

This is not a good movie. Anyone who claim this is a great fantastic movie probably have some issues. But this is neither as horrible as I see some people argue. This is just a middle-of-the-road sometimes funny decently entertaining movie with bad music and very lazy writing.\\n\\nThe good is that this is decently fun, even funny a few times. And if you are a fan of the games, especially Mario Cart, you will smile through many scenes. The voice acting is great, and if you are a simple kid you are likely going to love this. Sadly there ends the good stuff.\\n\\nThe bad starts with the story, or rather lack thereof. Because it is as simplistic as the games which is both a strength and a weakness, but mostly a weakness because this movie offers nothing. It is actually kinda soulless and cliche. The music is mostly atrocious. Just put on Mario Cart music on bad speakers and you basically have this movie. But what really bothers me though is that the lack of story and very simplistic writing which feels so lazy. No one really cared. They only wanted to make a fast paced Super Mario Movie with as many callbacks and in-house jokes as possible, and that is it. There is no deeper meaning, nothing new, no real character development, nothing worth noting. Also most of the fun stuff you already saw in the trailer, it is not much else. So lazily done.\\n\\nSure you might have fun watching this, because it is not a bad movie, but will you remember this a few weeks from now? Will this be a classic? Do you want to see more? The answers to those questions is a big \"No\".\\n\\nIn the end I give this a 5/10. If you have kids you think you might like this or you are high and want to get away from reality for a while, perhaps go see this. For the rest of you this will be a Meh at best.'}\n",

Then, in 1993, Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park proved to be a game changer, amazing audiences with realistic prehistoric monsters created inside a computer. The problem since then has been in delivering that 'wow factor' - how can Hollywood keep on thrilling audiences when Spielberg's original set the bar so high? To be honest, I don't think they've found the answer yet.\\n\\nThe special effects in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom are technically brilliant, but the film doesn't really do anything that we haven't seen before, making the film as a whole yet another underwhelming experience. In desperation, the film-makers have resorted to more outrageous set-pieces, as well as inventing bigger and badder dinosaurs that never actually existed, all of which requires way too much suspension of disbelief.\\n\\nAnd talking of pushing the boundaries of believability too far, the notion that velociraptors were intelligent enough to be trained is quite preposterous: they had pea brains, experts rating their intelligence on a par with a rabbit. Anyone stupid enough to try and become a veloci-whisperer would wind up as a meal for the ravenous lizard (except, of course, for the fact that velociraptors were, in reality, only the size of a large chicken!).\\n\\nOther things that had me rolling my eyes: Chris Pratt becoming an MMA fighter to plough his way through countless bad guys; a dinosaur that pretends to be asleep to catch someone off-guard; velociraptor Blue knowing only to attack the villains; the transportation of numerous ginormous dinosaurs to a mansion in the US without the knowledge of the authorities; and obligatory child Maisie (Isabella Sermon) ultimately releasing the captured beasts into the wild because she feels sorry for them.

'The Lost World' has its admirers, but for me it was a major step-down and one of Spielberg's weakest films, and 'Jurassic Park 3' was even more disappointing.\\n\\n'Jurassic World' was not a patch on the first 'Jurassic Park', but for all its faults and uneven parts it was a massive improvement to me on the previous two sequels and was an entertaining film in its own right that did more right than it does wrong. Seeing the bigger, bolder, darker (generally) and grimmer 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' a few weeks ago but have been behind with film reviewing and with being busy it has taken until now to review it, personally found it to be a better film but can understand the mixed critical reception.\\n\\nFirst things off, 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' is an incredibly well-made film, it's beautifully shot with scenery that's both colourful and atmospheric and the dinosaurs look wonderful. The dinosaurs also steal the film, not just their designs but also that they're lots of fun and are scary, their scenes are great to watch and there could have been even more than there were.\\n\\nThis is especially true with the Indoraptor, who is chillingly bloodthirsty, when attacking it's enough to be glued to one's seat and then jump out of it. Blue's role also has a lot of touching heart. Michael Giacchino's music score is positively stirring, and even includes themes from Williams' score for 'Jurassic Park', which was just a lovely homage and fits within the rest of the scoring beautifully.\\n\\n'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' has a nostalgic quality, some of it is savvy and funny and while not as much as the original there's still a good amount of thrills and fun dinosaur action (especially the scary opening sequence) to be had. Parts are thought-provoking in primarily the first half and the darker and grimmer tone is handled mostly with a good amount of suspense. The direction is neat and while the acting is uneven there are charismatic performances from Chris Pratt and particularly Bryce Dallas Howard, as the film's most developed and evolved character in a film that expands on themes and ideas from the previous 'Jurassic World' and Isabella Sermon like Blue provides some heart. Liked the relief characters, especially Zia and James Cromwell and Jeff Goldblum are nice in small roles.\\n\\nSadly, the film is not without its drawbacks. The villains are underdeveloped pantomimic stereotypes with confused motivations. Ted Levine is especially wronged as a mere underused cartoon, while Rafe Spall is completely flat and Toby Jones is wasted.\\n\\nThe final third, after such a great opening sequence and intriguing first half, has suspense but also gets repetitive and silly with behaviours so face palm-inducing that the character is begging to be eaten (Levine's character especially).\\n\\nFurthermore, the story could have done with a less is more (with elements that over-complicate the proceedings with inconsistent motivations and plot points and ideas not used to full potential) and less rushed approach. Some of the dialogue was less than great with some cheese and verbosity going on.\\n\\nIn summary, decent and entertaining but not mind-blowing. 7/10 Bethany Cox\"}\n",

While I will never tire of seeing really cool dinosaurs on the big screen, I'll probably never avoid frustration from a poorly written and poorly acted film. On the bright side, I got to see this at the Grand Opening of the beautiful new Alamo Drafthouse in Denton, Texas. A 66 foot curved screen with the best available sound system made the dinosaurs that much more impressive, while simultaneously exposing the acting for the disappointment it is ... especially the almost impossible to watch Bryce Dallas Howard.\\n\\nJ.A. Bayona directs this follow up to the 2015 JURASSIC WORLD, but he's saddled with a subpar script from the writers and director of that previous entry, Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow. The creatures of the late, great Michael Crichton deserve better. In addition to the aforementioned Ms. Howard (as Claire Dearing), Chris Pratt also returns as the smirking Owen Grady, and this time he flashes some fighting skills that would make Jean-Claude Van Damme proud. Not sure how his experience training baby dinosaurs and building a cabin in the mountains prepared him to single handedly take on an army of armed mercenaries, but such things are possible in a cartoon ... which is exactly what this plays like: a live action cartoon with high dollar special effects.\\n\\nWe have a spoof of a villain in Eli Mills, played by an over-the-top Rafe Spall, a quivering techie played by Justice Smith (PAPER TOWNS), a tough Paleo vet in Daniela Pineda (MR ROOSEVELT), a dying billionaire former partner of John Hammond played by James Cromwell, a greedy capitalist who should be twirling a mustache in Toby Jones, a big-gun toting badass by Ted Levine, and a good-hearted housekeeper played by Geraldine Chaplin. Mr. Cromwell and Ms. Chaplin add a touch of class in their all too brief scenes. BD Wong is back doing things with dino DNA, and sadly, Jeff Goldblum probably filmed his two courtroom scenes in a couple of hours. One nice addition is young Isabella Sermon, in her screen debut. She is part of the only decent twist in the story.\\n\\nDespite the disappointments, it remains awe-inspiring to see the dinosaurs on screen. If only those moments weren't ruined by such superfluous bits such as a close up of Ms. Howard's footwear to prove that she's not wearing high heels in the jungle this time. Director Bayona has three very fine movies under his belt: THE ORPHANAGE (2007), THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012), and A MONSTER CALLS (2016). He's likely to make more good films during his career, and this will surely be a box office smash because people love seeing the dinosaurs, and are willing to overlook the people. As a frequent movie goer, I'm just unable to cut slack to a mega-budget film that expects us to overlook shoddy writing and laughable acting. We don't expect to recapture the (25 years ago) magic of Steven Spielberg and composer John Williams in the stunning JURASSIC PARK, but we do expect a better effort than this.\"}\n",

Awful.', 'movie_id': '4881806', 'author': 'rabbitmoon6', 'date': 'June 2018', 'content': 'Its as much of a non-film as I can remember. Somehow, Spielberg made a cup of water and the sound of footsteps far more suspenseful and engaging than anything in this movie. The dinosaurs are just sort of... there. Same goes for Chris Pratt, who features in scenes but only mildly forwarding the story with a few rescues or whatever. There are some cringe-worthy moments - firing a gun underwater to break glass, everyone being submersed but having perfect hair/makeup after, a horribly acted young girl who has the most shoe-horned and pointless subplot ever (as well as a nonsensical, cringe inducing climactic line). So much of the story makes no sense, a hybrid dino is basically produced and supposedly trained to follow laser sighting overnight. Yet has no buildup, suspense or point whatsoever. The whole thing is stranger than a David Lynch movie. Its like a string of bland cutscenes to a dull videogame.\\n551 out of 976 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

      "{'ratings': '7/10', 'title': 'Entertaining', 'movie_id': '4881806', 'author': 'Abdulxoxo29', 'date': 'January 2021', 'content': \"One of the best things about this movie is the little horror feel. The tension created in one scene where a dinosaur is creeping up on a child was fantastic. There were a few other moments inspired by the horror genre. I wish there'd been even more. I enjoyed the action sequences in Fallen Kingdom. The frustrating thing however is that the use of CGI was still too often an unwelcome distraction. Not all of the dinosaurs were convincing. As far as the storyline is concerned, that was a real let down. Enough time wasn't spent on the island. I think the idea behind the conspiracy was not very convincing. There was a subplot involving a little girl that I didn't think was necessary; but given that it was included, I'd then say that enough time wasnt spent on it. The creativity of the writers as for the need to create a brand new dinosaur to be the big threat is questionable. Creativity in general was kinda lacking actually. The performances were definitely better. Howard was better than last time. Chris Pratt also improved. There was a scene where he was coming out of paralysis, his physical performance was hilarious. He was also great in any of the scenes that involved Blue, his pet-like velociraptor. It shared a little similarity with the relationship between Dwayne Johnson and George the gorilla in 'Rampage'. As far as the villains are concerned, they failed to make much of an impression. Rafe Spall was ok at best. Toby Jones was sinister, but in more of a cartoonish villain sort of way. Also Ted Levine looked like future dino food from the moment you met him.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this movie was slightly disappointing. However, there were some individual moments that's enjoyable. There were some really impressive action sequences; and most of the dinosaurs looked great. the acting much better; and most of all, the elements of horror in the movie were fantastic. These darker scenes were the highlights.\"}\n",

Not super dark, but it's definitely not the fun thrill ride the first Jurassic World was sporting. There was too many real life human issues going on. The whole movie is basically about was man kind right to bring the dinosaurs back and sometimes man kind's attempts to advance itself have lead to disasters because All we know how to do is exploit stuff. A marriage of messages that was in all the other films in the franchise, but did not feel so knife in the gut as this one.\\n\\nThough I loved Jeff Goldblum's cameo as Dr. Malcolm, cause it was cool seeing him there, I admit it was preachy, and set that grim tone.\\n\\nI feel like Chris Pratt did not get to shine the way he's good at. Did not use his humorous personality as mush in this film, same with Bryce Dallas Howard. They still have what they have in the first film, but unusual for a sequel it seems more tone down than boosted up.\\n\\nOverall, as cliche as it is to say Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is not as good as Jurassic World\\n\\nIt looks like the franchise is going the way of the rebooted Planet of the Apes franchise, in that case I am looking forward to seeing the next movie.\"}\n",

It is a decent film I love the film. I would put it in my second favorite Jurassic Park film in the franchise. I know I am going to get a lot of hate because it is not a rant. In my opinion it is a good film I love it, if you hate the film is your opinion I have no problems with the film, but it is an improvement over Jurassic World I hated that film. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard returns and they are decent I love them in the film so much.\\n\\nWhen the island's dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen and Claire mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.\\n\\nI enjoy the practical effects, the explosions, the acting, the story and the action. I love the CGI effect for the raging volcano This is a faster paced film it goes fast around. I enjoyed the film it was entertaining and I wasn't bored with it. I understand the story, the twist and what they try to do with the film. I got this movie on Blu-ray disc and I enjoy it, I enjoy the film it is a guilty pleasure of mine. Call it whatever you want it I love it.\\n\\nChris Pratt as Owen Grady was decent and really a good hero, he does good performance, he has more stuff to do than in the first one. Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing was one hot mama who showed emotions and she cared about dinosaurs and a rescue mission. She wasn't annoying she was fine and entertaining. I like Bryce Dallas Howard because she was in Spider-Man 3 as Gwen Stacy and I have enjoyed her performance more than Emma Stone in The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2. I enjoy Ted Levine in this movie he was in Joy Ride and The Hills Have Eyes remake and I enjoy his performance to be a bad guy. I enjoyed Isabella Sermon as Maise little girl she wasn't annoying I liked her. Rafe Spall was awesome as Eli Mills the villain he was practically like Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser) from Aliens who wanted a profit of capturing aliens while Mills try's to get rich by selling a live dinosaurs.\\n\\nCGi are better than in the previous movie and gets criticism for trying something different. At least this movie did not copy the first one or other movies like Jurassic World did. I love the first Jurassic Park to death it is the best one in the franchise by a novel who directed Steven Spielberg. I love Jurassic Park III and this one. Directed was by J. A. Bayona who made a good direction. I enjoy the film I would put the film between Aliens and Deep Rising the opening sequence is a really horror aspect, you see a man been eat by a sea monster. Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow wrote a script for the film and they did a good job Colin Trevorrow previously directed Jurassic World so I respect him.\\n\\nI love the idea the rescuing dinosaurs from raging volcano I thought was better idea then the Jurassic World did. The rescue mission was a ploy and Claire and Owen must try to save the dinosaurs from been sold on a black marked. The problems and dumb idea was the cloning little girl that was stupid and bad idea. Of course the T Rex- Veloceraptor blood transfusion was a bad idea too.\\n\\nMy favorite scenes are in which Indoraptor hunts Owen and Maise throughout the mansion they are both on the roof but Claire shows up and distracts Indoraptor and of course Blue Velociraptor comes and saves them, kills prototype Indoraptor I loved that in the film. Jeff Goldblum has a cameo scene in the beginning of the film as Ian Malcolm and on the end of the film I don't mind him. BD Wong as Dr. Wu is also back as the bad guy he does a solid job. I love Claire and Franklin in an abandoned gyro-sphere to flee from the pyroclastic flow, but falls into the ocean that scene scared me because I thought they could have died for real. Excellent scene in the movie one of my favorites.\\n\\nI watch this movie twice in the row now, I know it is not perfect film it is not the greatest movie or the best one ever, I know it is stupid but I love it. I enjoy the film it is my second favorite film in the franchise. That is my opinion I forgot they mention a guy who is an arms dealer and they mention Slovenian my country yes I am from Slovenia so I am honored by this movie.\"}\n",
      "My Favorite Since Jurassic Park\n",
      "{'ratings': '10/10', 'title': 'My Favorite Since Jurassic Park', 'movie_id': '4881806', 'author': 'PoisonKeyblade6', 'date': 'June 2018', 'content': \"Three years ago, we were gifted with the new franchise entry Jurassic World, a film that broke records and stole my heart. It was a beautiful love letter to the original films, deeply rooted in nostalgia, but it also amped up the action and gave us a new set of characters to fall in love with. I loved every minute of it, and never wanted it to end.\\n\\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a completely new monster. This carries the basic DNA of what we expect from a Jurassic movie, but takes it to crazy new heights, relying very little on nostalgia or setup from earlier installments. New director J.A. Bayona brings a new perspective to the sweeping action set pieces and a dark, riveting tone that isn't present in any of the other franchise entries. The ensemble cast, including Chris Pratt's charismatic Owen Grady, Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing, and (my personal favorite) newcomer Isabella Sermon's Maisie Lockwood, all bring something to the table that fits together in a nice cohesive way thanks to a lot of onscreen chemistry. Maisie is the anchor of film's twisty story, and she is just downright adorable unlike some of the annoying children this series is known for. Depending on how you look at it, the real stars are the dinosaurs and special effects, which are the best they've ever been. This one feels like a love letter to the dinosaurs themselves in more than one respect. Best of all, though: this might be my favorite sequel since the original Jurassic Park.\\n\\nThe opening sequence alone made me fall in love with the film almost immediately, already setting up the scarier tone and feel. This movie has such a large scope that it dwarfs any other Jurassic film in that way. It just feels bigger, and of course it's extremely entertaining. The action pace is nonstop, but Bayona also gifts us with beautiful and tender shots (there's one in particular that broke my heart) and great character beats. The claustrophobic setting of the film's second half is atmospheric gothic horror meets creature feature. It's something I never thought I would say about any Jurassic film, but it felt exciting and new and certainly nothing like what we've seen previously.\\n\\nFallen Kingdom is a dark, explosive blockbuster that takes the series in an exciting new direction and I absolutely loved it. It expands the scope of the series in such a way that it feels like there is so much more story left to tell here. I can't wait to see it again, and I can't wait to see where this series will go next.\"}\n",

Its every bit as majestic and great as it has been before.\\n\\nThe Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) just had a baby cub named Simba. All of the animals come to the ceremony, except for Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons). Scar desperately wants to be King, but can't. As long as Mufasa and Simba are there. Soon Simba is able to walk and talk and is voiced by Jonathon Taylor Thomas. After hearing about an elephant graveyard from Scar, he and his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) visit it. They meet three bumbling hyenas: Banzai (Cheech Marin), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), and Ed (Jim Cummings), but they manage to leave unhurt. Scar is upset that the hyenas didn't do the job, so he orders a stampede to wipe out both of them, but it only takes care of Mufasa. Scar convinces Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Scar. So Simba flees into exile.\\n\\nThe Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn't need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.\\n\\nThe music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous. But Hans Zimmer's music really bowled me over and made my heart do calisthenics. Unlike such new Disney pics like Lilo and Stitch, the songs actually did some good. They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.\\n\\nI really like James Earl Jones (he's pretty diverse), and this time was no exception. He seemed to act like he didn't want to do this role, but he couldn't contain his excitement for wanting to do voice-overs again (he had done some work in The Simpsons before). Matthew Broderick redeemed himself for me (after the atrocious Ferris Bueller's Day Off) by showing a strong voicing as the adult Simba. Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jim Cummings really had good chemistry together, even though they didn't have much screen time. Irons was really good and creepy as Scar (one of those who you can't help but hate), and if that is him really singing, brava!\\n\\nBe warned, The Lion King isn't really for youngsters. It had intense thematic elements that should have warranted a PG, instead of those that don't deserve it (Lilo and Stitch, again). The mood that the music and the script brought out could damper your day, so be warned.\\n\\nThis is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don't say `haha, he's dead', you say `Gasp! I'm so sad!' If it weren't for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made.\\n\\nThe Lion King is a majestic movie, not without humor, that is for almost all to see.\\n\\nMy rating: 9/10\\n\\nRated G for intense thematic elements.\"}\n",

It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write like that. The best song is \"Can you feel the Love Tonight?\" but the others go without fault, \"Circle of Life\" is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic, and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10.

      "A dazzling, joyous piece of film-making\n",
      "{'ratings': '10/10', 'title': 'A dazzling, joyous piece of film-making', 'movie_id': '0110357', 'author': 'moviesleuth29', 'date': 'August 2009', 'content': 'Of all the animation classics from the Walt Disney Company, there is perhaps none that is more celebrated than \"The Lion King.\" Its acclaim is understandable: this is quite simply a glorious work of art.\\n\\n\"The Lion King\" gets off to a fantastic start. The film\\'s opening number, \"The Circle of Life,\" is outstanding. The song lasts for about four minutes, but from the first sound, the audience is floored. Not even National Geographic can capture something this beautiful and dramatic. Not only is this easily the greatest moment in film animation, this is one of the greatest sequences in film history.\\n\\nThe story that follows is not as majestic, but the film has to tell a story. Actually, the rest of the film holds up quite well. The story takes place in Africa, where the lions rule. Their king, Mufasa (James Earl Jones) has just been blessed with a son, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), who goes in front of his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) as next in line for the throne. Scar is furious, and sets in motion plans to usurp the throne for himself. After a tragedy occurs and Mufasa is killed, Scar persuades Simba to flee, leaving himself as king. Simba grows up in exile, but he learns that while he can run away from his past, he can never escape it.\\n\\nWhen viewing the film, it is obvious that \"The Lion King\" is quite different from its predecessors (and successors). This is an epic story that contains more dramatic power than all the other Disney films combined. While there are definitely some light-hearted moments, there is no denying the dark drama that takes up the bulk of the story. While it could be argued that Disney is the champion of family entertainment, this film is not for the very young. Some of the sequences are very dark and violent, many bordering on frightening, even for the older crowd.\\n\\nThe voice actors are terrific. Jonathan Taylor Thomas brings a large dose of innocence to Young Simba. He\\'s mischievous, but also terribly naive. His older counterpart, voiced by Matthew Broderick, equals him. He\\'s older, but no less mature. The voices are so similar that it\\'s almost impossible not to believe that they are the same character at different ages. Perhaps no one could have been better suited for the role of Mufasa than James Earl Jones. His baritone voice gives the Mufasa a quality of great power and wisdom; there is no question that his role is king. As Scar, Jeremy Irons is pitch-perfect. The drawing of the character is villainous, but Irons\\' vocal work complements the animation to create one of the most memorable, and vicious, villains in Disney history. He\\'s unquestionably evil, but he\\'s also clever, which makes him all the more dangerous. Manipulation, not violence is his greatest weapon. Providing some much needed comic relief are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts (a meerkat and a warthog), and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. While there is definite fun from these characters, neither the actors nor the filmmakers allow them to go over-the-top and destroy the mood of the film.\\n\\nDisney\\'s animated features are known for their gorgeous artwork. Nowhere is this more apparent than in \"The Lion King.\" Every single frame is jaw-dropping. The colors are rich, and the drawings are sharp and beautiful. One of the pitfalls of animation (both computer and hand-drawn) is that there is sometimes a visible distance between the subject and the background, making it seem as if the figure animation was cut and pasted on the background (this is obviously what happens, but it is up to the artists to make sure that it isn\\'t noticeable). There is none of that here.\\n\\nThroughout the Golden Age of Disney animation, the films have been musicals. \"The Lion King\" is no different, and the songs are brilliant. All of the numbers are standouts (\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" won the Oscar, but in my opinion, \"The Circle of Life\" was better). In the cases of Simba and Nala (Simba\\'s girlfriend), both young and old, there is a noticeable difference between the speaking and singing parts (everyone else does their own singing and speaking), but never mind. It still works, and that\\'s what\\'s important.\\n\\n\"The Lion King\" is not flawless, but on first viewing, they aren\\'t noticeable, and it is likely that the young won\\'t ever notice them. \"Beauty and the Beast\" was the first animated film to get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (it lost to \"The Silence of the Lambs\"), and is thus far the only animated film to receive such an honor. That being the case, it\\'s hard to understand why \"The Lion King\" was not given the same distinction. The two films are more or less equal in quality, and the nominees for the honor that year were not strong.\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t already, see \"The Lion King.\" You won\\'t be disappointed.'}\n",

I realize that it has been criticized for political incorrectness. The fact of the matter is that it has strong female characters as well as male, and it's about a vision of monarchy. I have the greatest respect for female role models but I really don't see this as a worthy criticism. It's a great story of defeat and betrayal and renewal. It has delightful individual characters, dressed up to show their beings in a clever way. It has the most despicable villains with Scar and the Hyenas. It has the Henry II thing about duty. It doesn't glorify fooling around as one of my colleagues told me. The free life is OK but at some time you must follow your heart and redeem yourself. The music is outstanding; another triumph or the Disney team. There are three or four numbers that are so critical to a complete understanding of the events of the story. The sound effects person should have been rewarded because sound is so critical in this. From the stampede to the forbidden areas of the kingdom. I watched this about sixty times with my small children and never really tired of it. I would put this at the top of any list of animated adventures.\\n8 out of 10 found this helpful.

      "{'ratings': '9/10', 'title': 'A Modern Classic', 'movie_id': '0110357', 'author': 'thediggens5', 'date': 'June 2014', 'content': \"The Lion King is by general consensus the greatest Disney film from their glorious renaissance period (1989-1999), and is undoubtedly worthy of such recognition. Notably, it is the highest rated Western animation on IMDb's own Top 250, which while flawed and imprecise is a good indicator of quality.\\n\\nA loose adaption of Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Lion King is visually stunning, the peak of hand-drawn animation, with a strong voice cast and a wide selection of memorable tunes. It is a tight ~80 minutes, and one sometimes forgets just how quick the movie moves, yet it does so deftly. The characters are well defined, and the arc of Simba's growth, the core of the film, evolves satisfyingly. One could question whether more time should have been spent on Simba's growth in the middle act (there is incredulous imagery as Simba grows exponentially next to the stasis of Timon and Pumba), but to meander so would ask it to be an entirely different film.\\n\\nWhile it is not uncommon for a side character or two overshadow the main (see the Genie in Aladdin), Matthew Broderick and Jonathan Taylor Thomas (adult and young Simba respectively) are at risk from nearly all of the phenomenal cast. James Earl Jones is a commanding presence, and Jeremy Irons as Scar steals every scene. The 'fools' of the film, be it Timon & Pumba, the Hyena trio or even Zazu, all provide the levity believably, that would otherwise leave an incredibly sombre film. Nala is powerful, though one must note that she seems at times far more capable than Simba to actually achieve anything. Nevertheless, Simba's coming-of-age arc, while predictable, is enjoyable, helped along by fantastic charisma and choice songs.\\n\\nThe fact that the film has spawned a wildly successful musical gives a strong indication of the quality of the music, but what is less said is how beautiful the film is. As The Lion King was being released, works were already moving away from hand-drawn animation, with Toy Story released a year later. And The Lion King might be the peak of hand-drawn, with an enormous palate of creativity and variety. The opening vista for 'Circle of Life', the bursts of colour in 'Can't wait to be King' and the sombre tone of 'Be Prepared' all are gorgeous. Yet, special mention must go to the Stampede scene, one of the finest scenes of animation ever.\\n\\nOne thing I've developed from multiple viewings is how Timon and Pumba might be the weakest part of the movie. First, their 'life lessons' are essentially reversed by Rafiki. Certainly they are qualified to the point of being narratively sidelined. They feel contrived and even a detraction from the meat of the movie. Their role is the fast food portion of the film- the quick fix over more meatier bits of the film. The entertainment provided is enjoyable regardless, and is essential to round off the movie as Disney.\\n\\nThe Lion King is endlessly re-watchable, catchy, fun, while remaining a fantastic piece of cinema and an invaluable part of the Disney canon. Magnificent.\"}\n",

Life in the jungle declines under Scar\\'s rule as Simba abandons his identity and meets new friends, Timon and Pumbaa, in another part of the jungle.\\n\\nRoger Allers and Rob Minkoff directed an exciting movie, adopting more of what I think are some of mainstream Hollywood\\'s intense drama and comedy styles, seen in such parts like Uncle Scar and his crafty hyena goons chasing away poor Simba like gangsters pursuing a helpless hero, and the parts of the more modern day jokes and punchlines made by Timon and Pumbaa. The movie is also full of drama and action that will attract an audience of all ages, providing a great source of entertainment. It is compelling to see how Simba tries to wrestle his way out of his doubts as he tries to find his true identity and compelling to see Simba\\'s family try to overcome adversary under Scar\\'s rule. This is also a powerful story about courage, duty and identity (noticable as Simba tries to find his way) and the importance of family.\\n\\nHans Zimmer did a good job on the music score and Elton John wrote some memorable songs like \"Circle of Life\" and \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight.\" The toe-tapping \"I Just Can\\'t Wait To Be King\" is my favorite.\\n\\nThe characters are likable and, like the plot\\'s style, take on more of a mainstream Hollywood approach. This movie differs from the more earlier films such as \"Cinderella\" and \"The Jungle Book,\" and even the later films such as \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"Beauty and the Beast.\" \"The Lion King\" doesn\\'t have that Disney touch you\\'ve come to expect and love in many of the fairytale and adventure movies, signaling that Disney films have evolved immensely over time. Even though it\\'s not one of the more conventional Disney films, \"The Lion King\" is still a very good movie to watch due to its original concept, captivating story and memorable characters.\\n\\nGrade B+'}\n",

The story is nice and free flowing and without any unnecessary bumpers. One can not recognized the voices behind the characters, because the characters are so prominent. Music! Let me say I am not very fond of English pop songs, but I could hum almost most of the songs of this movie, so I would say, music is that nice. Animation is superb, landscapes are eye catching, dialogues are sharp and comedy is at its best.

The African land scape\\'s are beautiful and so are the animations of the animals itself.\\n\\nWhat makes \"The Lion King\" such a special movie is the emotional dept the story has. The story plays a significant role in the movie and it has some good adult moments. The entire movie has a more of an adult feeling, unlike earlier made Disney\\'s that mainly focused on only young children. Still there also is plenty to enjoy for the young ones, especially the characters Timon and Pumbaa shall be loved by them.\\n\\nThe story is filled with symbolism and reference to mainly the communist regime.\\n\\nThe voice cast is good, mainly of course thanks to James Earl Jones who has an amazing good deep voice. Also the three hyenas are voiced perfectly by Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings. Jeremy Irons who voices the main villain Scar really brings his character to live and makes the movie even more worth watching.\\n\\nThere are some typical Disney songs that are good. Also surprising good is the musical score itself composed by Hans Zimmer who also received an Oscar for it. His first and only one but hopefully not his last. Also Tim Rice and Elton John received an Oscar for the song \" Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" and were nominated for two other songs from this movie.\\n\\nA must see animated movie with some scene\\'s and songs that you\\'ll not easily forget.\\n\\n9/10\\n\\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/'}\n",

I, as well as many others, am a huge fan of the first film and the short films that followed it. Frozen II has a different feel to it. While the first film was brimming with quirky moments, the follow up feels a little more mature in its plot and themes. This story heavily centers around the importance of change, even if that means letting go. Throughout the film, I found myself dazzled with the quality and beauty of the visuals that the animation team laid out. The story, for me, felt a little flat, however. I think the writing team missed the mark when trying to achieve the same quirkiness from the original. With the more dramatic path the writers chose to take, also came more epic musical numbers and effects. Sure there were still plenty of humorous moments, but I personally felt myself longing for more. I also find irony in the fact that this film centers around change and the overall feel of the film felt like a major shift from the first. I do think this film will still appeal to many others and I, myself, am still very excited to watch it a second time. Overall, I'd say this film found success in what it was trying to achieve and the message it was trying to send to its viewers, but couldn't quite live up to the whimsicality of the original. While not as good as the first, it's still a film you will want to take your family to and is a great addition to the Frozen franchise. 7/10\"}\n",

I think the story is more, which is not necessarily better for the kids since it need a bit more thinking and understanding, but as an adult this sequel has a lot more to offer. I also think this is funnier, and oh God it is beautiful to watch. The cinematic experience of seeing this beauty on screen is magical... and yes, magical is the word of the day. Elsa also goes fully magical and has several really cool superpower moments. And did I mention how beautiful this movie is to watch?\\n\\nI also felt all the emotions.

It drags a little bit from the end of the first act into the second act, and I think a few situations and events could have gone different. But those are very minor complaints.

It is so beautifully animated, has two great lead characters with a heartfelt bond between them and the songs are wonderful, especially \"For the First Time in Forever\", \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman\" and \"Let It Go\".\\n\\nSo hopes were very high for this long-awaited sequel, which looked great from the advertising and the good word of mouth further sparked interest. Am somebody that never shows any bias or intended at least bias towards sequels, despite their reputations. Watching \\'Frozen 2\\', it is one of not many sequels in existence to be very nearly as good as its predecessor. Not quite as good, to me the first is a little bit better, but compares favourably in comparison to a lot of films released in the latter part of this year.\\n\\n\\'Frozen 2\\' isn\\'t perfect.

For me, the best-looking of the animated films released this year. Not just the meticulous attention to background and character detail and rich colours, but in particular those jaw-droppingly gorgeous landscapes. The songs are not quite \"Let It Go\", but are still the very meaning of razzle dazzle in a good way. \"Into the Unknown\" and \"Show Yourself\", both of which leave a vast emotional impact, are the best, though \"Lost in the Woods\" is also pretty entertaining. Writing is pitched perfectly, the dramatic moments are genuinely touching like in the first 10 minutes and the humorous moments very sharply written and smart.\\n\\nPlus, Anna and Elsa are such great, relatable characters and their relationship once again provides a lot of heart. Have never had a problem with Olaf, Sven is adorable and Iduna is a compelling addition. The story is not perfect in the pace and it is simple, but on the most part it\\'s very absorbing, it\\'s just as fun and heartfelt as that for the first film. It also stands out for its darker tone and deeper themes that don\\'t feel too much of a shift. All the original voice actors are back on board and all do fine jobs and display powerhouse vocals once more, especially Idina Menzel, who continues to bring so much heart and soul into Elsa, and Evan Rachel Wood likewise as Iduna.\\n\\nConcluding, very well done sequel to a great first film. 8/10'}\n",

      "{'ratings': '10/10', 'title': 'Beautiful Sequel To One of the Greatest Animated Films Ever Made', 'movie_id': '4520988', 'author': 'rannynm19', 'date': 'November 2019', 'content': 'Frozen II is a beautiful continuation of one of the greatest animated films ever made. We know the story and characters from the 2013 film, so it\\'s not as original, surprising and innovative as the first one, but as the story evolves so does the animation. The characters grow in their arc, becoming more mature, with stronger relationships and technically, Frozen II is a much better film than its predecessor.\\n\\nAnna (Kristen Bell), Elsa (Idina Menzel), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), Olaf (Josh Gad) and Sven have become a family. Now, they try to discover the origin of Elsa\\'s powers in order to save their Kingdom because it seems as if Elsa has awakened some powerful spirits. They leave Arandelle, their hometown, and embark into a Nordic odyssey, in the impetuous fall, where they will face dangers and will meet new characters.\\n\\nDuring the film\\'s 103 minutes, we are delighted with seven new songs, most of them as iconic as those in the previous film and 19 score tracks. \"Into the Unknown\" stays with you and I\\'m sure we will hear this beautiful composition at the Oscar ceremony. Frozen II feels like a musical at times and that just makes the movie better.\\n\\nThe story is well narrated and easy to follow for little ones. Sisterhood is a powerful force and the bond between Anna and Elsa only strengths during the whole movie.\\n\\nFrozen II is absolutely eye candy with a beautiful color palette similar to the original adding the warm tones of autumn. The filmmakers traveled to Finland, Iceland and Norway for inspiration. They consulted with a botanist in Oslo to make sure the forest resembles the authentic vegetation there. The animation is not just beautiful, but also a great representation of the Nordic folklore and the geography of the places.\\n\\nWe can also appreciate the advances in technology in the new characters. Among the most challenging to animate are Nokk, the water spirit and Gale, the wind spirit. The costumes are very detailed and gorgeous and, even Olaf gets to wear one!\\n\\nThe actors from the original cast reprise their roles and Jason Ritter makes his Disney debut as the voice of Ryder. My favorite characters are Brunni, the salamander and Olaf played by Josh Gad. Olaf is very funny and his character becomes bigger in this sequel. My favorite scenes are the ones where the characters are discovering the elements in the forest, because each one represents a new challenge.\\n\\nThe message of the film is about creating your own destiny and not being afraid of growing up.\\n\\nI give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 16, as well as adults.

They took their time and made sure the sequel was worthy of the original's quality. Frozen 2 deepens the mythology of the series while also exploring Anna & Elsa's parentage even further than I expected. The songs are expectedly superb (except for a few unnecessary tracks in the middle act), the animation is glorious, and I was once again moved to teary eyes towards the ending. Perhaps it doesn't completely reach the heights of the first film (not many animated films do) but I can see myself going back and enjoying the sequel just as much as I did with the first in 2013. 'Into the Unknown' is an absolutely smash hit too. So there's that.\\n\\n9.0/10\\n19 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.\\nPermalink\"}\n",

The animation was flawless, the songs were abundant and wonderful (nothing quite as earwormy as Let It Go, though) and the laughter was non-stop.\\n\\nThe character growth was also a treat. I didn't expect that, especially from a character like Olaf.\\n\\nAll the negative reviews I see complain about it either being too dark or all over the place. It was neither. Sure, it had some darkness to it, but so does life, and like most moments in life, their is a shining bright light waiting on the other side, even if it's not the ending I would have expected.\\n\\nAnd to those saying it was all over the place? It wasn't, if you bothered to pay attention. But most of you are adults who write off every animated feature as children's fare and don't really care to pay attention. And that is because you've lost the child inside. You've forgotten how to feel joy and excitement and embrace it like you did as a child. You confuse your contentedness with your children's happiness with actual joy and live vicariously through them than embracing what's inside of you and living your own happiness yourself.

Still, it is by no means a bad film (in my opinion that is), and I was pretty excited about the sequel, since I hoped that they would've taken the time to fix the problems I had with the first in the 6 year gap. Unfortunately though, the sequel turned out to be one of the most forgettable movies I saw in 2019, and I blame Disney's moneymaking scheme for that, seeing as they pushed the team way too hard to get the movie out duing the marketable holiday season. There are some good elements in the movie; The animation and the music is great as always, and Elsa's character at least improved a little from the first movie. I also think that the beginning of the movie is pretty good, setting up a lot of questions and getting you intrigued. The only problem is that the rest of the movie doesn't provide much to satisfy the curiosity. The exposition is awkwardly delivered, and the new subplots and characters introduced didn't really stick with me. On top of that, the existing characters felt like they were dumbed down for the movie. Kristoff's only purpose is seemingly to provide some awkward comedy, and Olaf didn't really interest me much either. Anna at least get something to do, but she didn't feel as full of personality as she did in the first movie. The climax is a let-down, the ending was really bad, and the movie as a whole didn't leave any impression on me. On top of that, the representation of Norwegian culture isn't very well handled, although they at least tried to implement new elements from it. Overall, it's just a watchable, mediocre, forgettable experience, and I have no intention to watch it again.\"}\n",

Because the background story of Iduna and adgar was very disappointing, they were not saints who had anything to do with magic or knew anything about it or else they would never have closed the gates of Arendelle and tried to hide Elsa's powers from everyone. It was just parents/king and queen who panicked after the incident and therefore acted how they did they didn't know how to get Elsa to control her powers and get ripped off by that troll.

For example, Meet The Robinsons, Chicken Little, Tangled, Zootopia, Wreck-it-Ralph, Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, Moana, Home on The Range, etc. Ralph Breaks The Internet was average at best, but on the other hand with Frozen 2....it was a painful experience of my life. I'm telling the truth I was not impressed with this movie at all. I don't actually hate this movie but I'll share my thoughts on this film. The story is pretty weak and kinda subpar, it could've been a lot better. The story for Frozen 2 should've been about a fierce war happening and a dreaded force came and threatened the kingdom of Arendelle and it's up to Elsa, Anna and her friends to end the war and stop the dreaded force. That could be a great sequel with some mature tone to it, but nope. It's about the secrets of family, seasons changing, blah blah blah. No war, no dreaded threat, nothing. Not even the characters are perfect, I mean look at Olaf. In the first film, he was entertaining but in this one, he was flanderized and he felt like a dry piece of toast. Yet, the animation, lighting and rendering is amazing to look at. Frozen 2 maybe a painful disappointment but hey, it's a lot better than other Disney sequels. Man, it seems like Disney is running out of ideas like for example look at the 2020 remake of Milan. Yeah, that film was a absolute mess. Watch Frozen 2 all you want and like it all you want but to me, I'm gonna stick to other movies please. I give Frozen 2 a 5.3/10\"}\n",

It's just as good as the previous film, Furious 7, which was great. The cast is mostly the same as the last movie, with the exception of Paul Walker of course and with the addition of a few new characters. Diesel, Johnson, Theron, Rodriguez, Statham, Eastwood, Russel, and Mirren are all great in the movie. The acting is to the same caliber as the last movie, I thought there were good performances all around. I loved Charlize Theron as Cipher, the villainess the team must deal with and stop from causing a potential World War III. I loved Scott Eastwood as the rookie assistant of Kurt Russel, perfect for the role. The plot was well written and very well executed. The special effects were typical fast and the furious style. Very loud, over the top and extremely exciting/fun effects. You will never ever be bored with the action sequences, that's for damn sure. And even though Brian and Mia aren't present in this movie, they do get a shoutout and the movie gives a very sweet, thoughtful tribute to Brian. Really the only thing I personally didn't care for and got kinda tired of was Tyrese Gibson and his characters jokes. I thought he was funny sometimes but it got to where every time the camera was on him he was making some joke and there were times when they just didn't really work. The chemistry between the actors are just as great as ever and I thought the movie was just a great very fun way to spend an evening, which is how I feel about the rest of the movies in the franchise.

I think is my number one favorite in the series Fast Five (2011) is still my number two favorite film in the series but this one just become my favorite number 1 film. Since Paul Walker died in November 30, 2013 both of the characters Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto retired and the seventh installment completed the story arcs for both of their characters.\\n\\nI think Vin Diesel who took over the movie without Paul walker did a great job I also finished him watching in his early action movie xXx (2002) pretty good movie. Dwayne Johnson was far way better than he was in Furious Seven. He had much more to do than in here than he did in the previous film that was my biggest problem in the previous installment. He was only in the beginning of the film and on the end of the film in the final showdown the rest of that film he was absent but in this film he had much more to do. Jason Statham is back as Deckard Shaw and he had much more things to do then he did in the previous film. Charlize Theron as Cipher was outstanding as the bad guy I liked her performance. Michelle Rodriguez as hot chick mom was really great I love her performance in this movie. Nathalie Emmanuel as Ramsey from the previous film is also in here. I love performances from Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges and Tyrese Gibson they were great.\\n\\nF. Gary Gray did not do a bad job directing this film I thought he was good. I think this movie is a good action movie and way better than the new Transformers films and Terminator films. I rather watch The Fast and the Furious films then those I mentioned. Chris Morgan was excellent writer in this movie.\\n\\nIn this movie Dom and Letty are on their honeymoon and Brian and Mia have retired from the game-and the rest of the crew has been exonerated-the globetrotting team has found a semblance of a normal life. But when a mysterious woman seduces Dom into the world of crime he can't seem to escape and a betrayal of those closest to him, they will face trials that will test them as never before. From the shores of Cuba and the streets of New York City to the icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea, the elite force will crisscross the globe to stop an anarchist from unleashing chaos on the world's stage... and to bring home the man who made them a family.\\n\\nAlso the movie takes on icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea which are cars on the ice, that idea was from James Bond 007 Die Another Day but still the movie borrowed I have enjoyed this movie. Everyone in this movie did great I am so happy I have this film on Blu-ray.\\n\\nI am not sure if hackers can hack into new cars and drive them during on the road with the computer I don't think that is impossible not with the technology was created in the decades, that's my opinion.\\n\\nI wasn't happy that Charlize Theron's character escaped but I hope we will see her in the next installments. I hear there are 2 installments planed and the 10th will be last one in the series.\\n\\nI don't think this movie is great or the best or better than Furious Seven I just think it is a good film.\\n\\nI love that Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham put their sides behind and start working together. I love the prison escape and love that Jason Statham saved Dominic's son on the plain. Deckard kill Han but he pay for it when he rescue Dom's son. I love the chemistry between Dom and Letty they are still married and together that's awesome.\\n\\nScott Eastwood is also in this and even tough he isn't that great he is enjoyable in this flick. I also love the poster and the cover on Blu-ray about this film it think it is excellent.\\n\\nThis film get's a 10/10 I have enjoyed this film a lot the submarine was awesome and I am glad that the crew save the world again.\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '8/10', 'title': 'I really respect how diverse a cast this franchise has always employed!', 'movie_id': '4630562', 'author': 'Hellmant18', 'date': 'April 2017', 'content': \"'THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS': Four Stars (Out of Five)\\n\\nThe eighth installment in the immensely popular blockbuster franchise, and only the second chapter not to include the late Paul Walker (following 2006's 'TOKYO DRIFT'). Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel and Kurt Russell all reprise their roles from the other films; while Charlize Theron, Scott Eastwood and Helen Mirren join the cast. F. Gary Gray (who's best know for helming 2015's 'STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON') directed this installment (he's also worked with Diesel before on 2003's 'MAN APART', and with Theron on 2003's 'THE Italian JOB'). It was once again written by Chris Morgan, who also wrote the last 6 chapters in the series. The film is also (once again) a huge hit at the Box Office, and it's also gotten mostly positive reviews from critics as well (like all of the other recent installments in the series). I enjoyed it too.\\n\\nDom Torretto (Diesel) and Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez) are on their honeymoon in Havana, when Dom is approached by a cyberterrorist known as Cipher (Theron). She seduces him into working for her, by showing him a picture of something that's obviously very important to him. Dom then betrays his team, and steals an EMP device from them. Agent Frank Petty (Russell) then recruits Letty, Luke Hobbs (Johnson), Deckard Shaw (Statham) and the rest of Dom's team to help them catch Dom, and stop Cipher.\\n\\nThe movie is action-packed, but it's also way too long (at over 2 hours and 15 minutes). For me, it definitely starts to drag a little in the middle of the film. I wasn't a big fan of the series when it first started, but I've been really impressed with the last several installments, and I think this is one of the best ones yet. It's not as good as the last chapter in the series, because that was a really fitting (and quite beautiful) tribute to Paul Walker, but it might be the second best one yet. And I really respect how diverse a cast this franchise has always employed; it's probably the most diversely cast blockbuster franchise in cinema history (but 'STAR WARS' is catching up to it though).\\n\\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/213917579\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '10/10', 'title': 'Big, loud, and awesome!', 'movie_id': '4630562', 'author': 'cruise0114', 'date': 'April 2017', 'content': \"The Fast and the Furious franchise has always made its way with being fun entertaining films. Cool cars, crazy insane action sequences that usually breaks the laws of physics, and lastly, the story always focuses on the theme of family. That is usually the case with the most of these movies, and the code that Dominic Toretto lives by. Old enemies become good and good go bad, so it seems when Dominic (Vin Diesel) betrays his team and family during an extract mission in Berlin. Stealing an emp device, and reporting to cyber terrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron). Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), and the rest of the team that we all know from the previous films have to track down Ciphers next move and stop Dom. Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) and the new addition (Scott Eastwood) will need Hobb and his team and the help from their former enemy Deckard (Jason Statham).\\n\\nI feel like the fast movies are getting better as it goes on from every movie and amazing to see how it went from a street racing movie to a heist film to a spy action. Also one that should not be taken seriously. It's a blockbuster action movie that you should leave brains and logic out before seeing the movie. Seeing these characters as a team go on glide trotting missions to stop cypher terrorism using sporty cars and tactical fast tanks. Does these missions even require them to use cars? Probably not, sure there is other ways they could have handled it. But than it wouldn't be a fast movie, would it.\\n\\nThe action sequences are big, loud, and insane. From the opening sequence, in Cuba, seeing Dom race with a burning car was fun. Until he meets Cipher that persuaded him to betray his team. Without giving away details, on Doms motivation to do such a thing against his family, it's best to see for yourself. The film also takes place in New York and has one insane scene when Cipher hacks into computerized cars for her own control and leading a wave of cars to invade a convoy. Last, the chase sequence with the cars being chased by a submarine was fun in a overlong battle that takes place in Russia.\\n\\nThe cast was still great and it was fun to see Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham taunt each other when working on a team. Helen Mirren has a brief appearance and is well worth it. Scott Eastwood was also a fun addition as a rookie to Mr. Nobody. Charlize Theron as the villain was a perfect choice. But sadly, she does not have much to do besides her menacing threats and being in a command room throughout the whole movie. The film does have its twist and turns in the direction, when characters family limit is tested. But in the end, the central theme will always be about family coming together.\\n\\nThe Fate of the Furious is awesome and does best for what it is trying to do which is entertain with crazy action sequences. Great cast. Fun to see these characters work together. Has its cheesy dialogue humor. And I hope to see more.\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '9/10', 'title': 'Family No More', 'movie_id': '4630562', 'author': 'ThomasDrufke14', 'date': 'April 2017', 'content': 'The Fate of the Furious is the start of a new trilogy, according to Vin Diesel. A trilogy that continues the ridiculous path taken by Fast 5, 6, and 7, but bringing in more spy elements and pushing aside the heist part of the series.\\n\\nMuch like Furious 7, this film finds the team of Dom, Letty, Hobbs, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey once again being targeted by someone. Last time, the team managed to take down Deckard Shaw, played by Jason Statham, who was out for revenge. Now, a tech-hacker-terrorist played by Charlize Theron forces Dom to turn his back on family and help her steal nuclear codes. Let me say this upfront, most of this movie doesn\\'t make any logical sense. In fact, this movie probably makes less sense than all of the other previous films combined. But did that impact my viewing experience in the slightest? Not one bit.\\n\\nSo even though this film can be perceived as the dumbest of the bunch, there\\'s no denying just how fun it is. Embracing the silliness is an understatement. Dodging a submarine, redirecting a torpedo with your hand, arm curling a steel bench, and pretty much stopping World War 3 are only a few of the things the team have to do. However, there\\'s a clear difference with this franchise than most. The F&F series has made it clear from the get-go that these stories always come down to family. So it may not seem like there are any consequences when they come out of fights without a single scratch, but if you buy into them as a family than it doesn\\'t really matter how unrealistic the film can get.\\n\\nWith the passing of Paul Walker, there\\'s a bit of a gap that may never truly be filled again without Brian O\\'Conner, but they did the best they could in spreading out what would have been O\\'Conner\\'s screen time. The Rock certainly gets a boost to second billed, after his limited presence in Furious 7. Between him, Diesel, Statham, Gibson, and Ludicrous, there\\'s probably close to 200 one- liners. And unlike with Triple X early this year, this Vin Diesel film actually made me laugh. They do a great job at giving each cast member their moment to shine. Particularly, the chemistry between Statham and The Rock really pops. If there\\'s a world where Vin Diesel would let them have a spin-off film together, I\\'d be the first in line.\\n\\nTheron is very good as Cipher, though I\\'m not sure how much I like the hacking/terrorist side of the villain. The \"God\\'s Eye\" was the least interesting part of the last movie and that\\'s easily the case with Cipher. I\\'ll buy into Dom\\'s crew taking down anybody with the rules (or lack thereof) that the franchise has set, but I\\'m just not all that invested in street racers taking on techies. I\\'d rather have a villain that our heroes can punch, which is why the last few films have been so fun. Which makes it even weirder that they didn\\'t decide to make Cipher physically capable, considering how good Theron was in Mad Max and how good she looks to be in the upcoming Atomic Blonde. Perhaps that was a missed opportunity.\\n\\nOverall, The Fate of the Furious once again ups the series in terms of ridiculousness and stupidity, which is exactly what I hoped for. It\\'s not as touching as Furious 7 nor as fun as Fast 5, but it\\'s no doubt a time worthwhile at the theaters.\\n\\n+Upping their game once again\\n\\n+Statham & The Rock\\n\\n+Family, family, family\\n\\n+Reinvents itself\\n\\n-Theron was good, but I don\\'t care for that type of villain\\n\\n9.3/10'}\n",

It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.\\n\\nOverall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.\"}\n",

As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance.

It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me.\\n\\nLoved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever.\\n\\nMore could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.\\n\\nScarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.\\n\\nHowever, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.\\n\\nRobert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character.\\n\\nLikewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion.\\n\\n'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart.\\n\\nMarvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored.\\n\\nOverall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '8/10', 'title': 'Breathtaking', 'movie_id': '4154756', 'author': 'jordanthomas_2009-346-91475812', 'date': 'June 2018', 'content': 'Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange\\'s Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos\\' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos\\' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It\\'s a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields.\\n\\nThanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet \\'Titan\\' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.\\n\\nEven though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it\\'s unpredictable. It\\'s full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That\\'s not to say they don\\'t get anything to do because they do, it\\'s just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it\\'s a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon\\'s need for artificial limbs, Thor\\'s new haircut and Drax\\'s constant quips.\\n\\nThere are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don\\'t look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it\\'s a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that\\'s just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its \"baggy\" or \"overlong\" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.'}\n",

I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in \"Endgame\" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly \"Infinity War\" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn\\'t have asked for more.\\n12 out of 18 found this helpful.

This live-action rendering of the studio\\'s 1991 animated version of the oft-told fairy tale is Disney\\'s way of giving family-friendly audiences a \\'treat\\' while raking in big money the easy way: by delivery a presold product, one with name and song value--and built-in approval ratings. At a debutante ball in 18th century France, an old hag casts a spell on the partygoers after she is rebuffed (seems she\\'s an enchantress in disguise, though we have no idea why); the selfish prince of the manor is then turned into a beastly creature, while his attendants are turned into (talking) objects. Her spell will be broken once the prince learns about true love, though this must happen before the last pedal on the enchantress\\'s rose falls... Ideally, this material is timeless and should entertain those who do not know the story and approach it with a fresh perspective. However, while Disney\\'s previous version broke new ground for animated musicals, this dark, lead-footed endeavor never lifts off, remaining flatly earthbound despite the familiar songs and characters. When trying for a little humor, scenarists Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos cannot come up with anything other than dry sarcasm, which doesn\\'t wear well on their princess Belle, played by a miscast Emma Watson. Whether feigning indignation or attempting to register awe, Watson approaches her part with a firm jaw and a righteous tone, as if this were a feminist mock-up; when she asks the Beast if he\\'s joking when he offers his castle to her, she sounds like the captain of a cheerleading squad. The art direction and design of this preconceived blockbuster is fussy and forgettable--no one will come out of this movie saying that it transported them to another time and place--while the unobtrusive supporting cast plays it safe, perhaps so as not to be in competition with their animated counterparts. Somewhere, French filmmaker Jean Cocteau (who helmed the 1946 version, \"La Belle et la Bête\") is smiling, for trendy blockbusters come and go but art remains truly timeless. *1/2 from ****'}\n",

The new songs, though surprising, fit remarkably well, and I never felt that the score missed a beat. And when all was added up, the sum was far more than any of the new and varied parts: this is a fresh masterpiece, beginning as a riff but ending with something much much more than a \"cover\" -- if Disney can do this as well with its other planned live-action/CGI versions, then count me in.

I had absolutely zero desire to see it because I really hate remakes. The only reason I did was because my wife insisted we go. And, when the wife insists...we go! I have now to thank my wife and must admit she was right...the film is terrific. The only reason I don\\'t score this one an A+ is simply because so much of it is a regurgitation of the wonderful 1991 cartoon version by Disney.\\n\\nSo why am I so positive about this movie? Well, to me it\\'s simply the most visually stunning and artistic film I have ever seen...and I have reviewed thousands and thousands of films. I went to the theater fully expecting to hate the picture...but soon found it took my breath away...not just once but again and again...it\\'s that beautiful. And, what I also really appreciate is that the film is the best looking CGI/live action combination I have ever seen and the 3D effects are much, much better than usual. With most live action films made in 3D, I generally leave with a feeling that I could have enjoyed the movie just as much in 2D as 3. And, all but a few scenes seem as if they were not even shot with 3D in mind. But not Beauty and the Beast. The filmmakers obviously thought out every possible aspect of the movie and each scene used the multidimensionality to its fullest. Because of that, I strongly recommend you not only see the film on the big screen but pay the extra money and see it in 3D. Really, you must see it on the big screen and in 3D. I have no desire to ever see the film on DVD or cable television...it is truly a big and impressive film you must experience in person. You can thank my wife later.\\n\\nBy the way, a side note: I know there\\'s been a lot of hubbub about the character Le Fou in this film because he\\'s gay. I think if Disney hadn\\'t said anything about this before the film was released, most folks would not have really cared one way or the other and many simply wouldn\\'t have noticed. It doesn\\'t smash you over the head and I don\\'t see this movie as some \\'gay agenda picture\\'...and I see it much like I see \"Some Like it Hot\".

Still excited I had high hopes for the film. Most of was shattered in the first 10 minutes. Campy acting with badly performed singing starts off a long journey holding hands with some of the worst CGI Hollywood have managed to but to screen in ages.\\n\\nA film that is over 50% GCI, should focus on making that part believable, unfortunately for this film, it's far from that. It looks like the original film was ripped apart frame by frame and the beautiful hand-painted drawings have been replaced with digital caricatures. Besides CGI that is bad, it's mostly creepy. As the little teacup boy will give me nightmares for several nights to come. Emma Watson plays the same character as she always does, with very little acting effort and very little conviction as Belle. Although I can see why she was cast in the film based on merits, she is far from the right choice for the role. Dan Stevens does alright under as some motion captured dead-eyed Beast, but his performance feels flat as well. Luke Evans makes for a great pompous Gaston, but a character that has little depth doesn't really make for a great viewing experience. Josh Gad is a great comic relief just like the original movie's LeFou. Other than that, none of the cast stands out enough for me to remember them. Human or CHI creature. I was just bored through out the whole experience. And for a project costing $160 000 000, I can see why the PR department is pushing it so hard because they really need to get some cash back on this pile of wet stinky CGI-fur!\\n\\nAll and all, I might be bias from really loving Disney's first adaptation. That for me marks the high-point of all their work, perfectly combining the skills of their animators along with some CGI in a majestic blend. This film however is more like the bucket you wash off your paintbrush in, it has all the same colors, but muddled with water and to thin to make a captivating story from.

It's beautiful, it's breathtaking, it's warm, it's hilarious, it's captivating, and, in Disney fashion, it's magical. When I learned that Disney would be remaking their classic films, B&TB was undeniably the best wrapped package. How could they go wrong?\\n\\nOh man, they went wrong.\\n\\nFirst thing's first: this film is so flat. The directing was dull and uninteresting throughout the entire film and it honestly felt like one of the Twilight sequels...and then I looked it up and found out that, yes, director Bill Condon was the man behind Breaking Dawn parts 1 & 2. Every shot looks bored and uninterested, which contrasts heavily with the original animated film that was constantly popping with vibrancy. The script too is boring because it's almost a complete remake of the original, though I guess most people won't mind that.\\n\\nNext: the CGI is horrid. Although I didn't care for The Jungle Book from last year, I could at least admit that the CGI was breathtaking. The same cant be said for this film. Characters like Lumière, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts, and most of the cursed appliances have very strange, lifeless faces that are pretty off putting to be looking at for such a long time. All of the sets too look artificial and fake, especially the town towards the beginning. However, the biggest offender is easily and infuriatingly the character that mattered most: The Beast. The CGI on the Beast's face is so distracting that it completely takes you out of the film. His eyes are completely devoid of soul, and his mouth is a gaping video game black hole of fiction. Klaus Kinski looked much better in the Faerie Tale Theatre episode of Beauty & The Beast, and that was a 1984 TV show episode. But do you know why it looked better? Because it was an actual face with actual eyes, not some video game computerized synthetic monstrosity. When will studios learn that practical effects will always top CGI?\\n\\nFinally: wasted casting. Emma Watson is beautiful, but she's no Belle. She is completely devoid of the warmth and humanity that made the animated Belle so beloved. Instead, she is cold and heartless throughout most of the film. Kevin Kline is 100% wasted and does nothing except look old. Ian McKellan, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson, and even Dan Stevens as the Beast are very expendable and could've been played by anyone else. The only good characters are Gaston and LeFou, mostly because they are fun and played by actors who breathe new life into their original shapes. If anything, this film should've been about Gaston and LeFou, but that would never happen because that would mean Disney couldn't cater to blind nostalgic 90's kids.\\n\\nOverall, this film is a complete bore. It could've been better if even the special effects were good, but the CGI in particular is horrendous. I'm all for Disney remaking their nostalgia- catering 90's films, but they need to be interesting. This film, sadly, is not. Even the Christmas sequel is better than this film because it's at least something.\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '7/10', 'title': 'A good, though far from great, adaptation of this tale as old as time.', 'movie_id': '2771200', 'author': 'shawneofthedead7', 'date': 'March 2017', 'content': \"Adapting Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve's original French story about a beauty and her beast is no easy task. In the wrong hands, this romance between a girl and her captor could easily come across as creepy – Stockholm Syndrome parading as a fairy tale. Disney managed to pull it off in 1991: its sublime animated version, with its tender heart and gorgeous music, has rightly become a classic. 25 years later, has the studio managed to capture lightning in a bottle again, this time in live-action format?\\n\\nWell\\x85 not quite. To be fair, this brand-new incarnation of Beauty And The Beast, directed by Bill Condon, has a great deal going for it. It makes a good case for updating the tale with more modern sensibilities. The film is beautifully performed and designed, and there's plenty of fun (and nostalgia) awaiting fans of its animated predecessor. But it never feels quite as effortless or natural in telling its story. While there is magic here, it's tough to shake the feeling that it's engineered, not organic – that it grazes rather than grabs the heart.\\n\\nThe film centres on Belle (Emma Watson), a bookish, resourceful young lady who's never really fit into her little French village. She hankers for adventure – but gets more than she bargained for when her father (Kevin Kline) stumbles into a forgotten castle and becomes a prisoner there. After trading places with her dad, Belle gets to know the inhabitants of the castle: a surly, fearsome Beast (Dan Stevens) and a host of living household appliances and furniture, all of them living in fear that they will never be free of the curse that has robbed them of their humanity.\\n\\nOn its own merits, Beauty And The Beast is a decent effort. Condon's film is the Hollywood blockbuster at its most efficient, from its photo-real fantasy castles to splashy musical numbers teeming with life and colour. The screenplay, by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos, is a canny adaptation of familiar material, particularly when it comes to adding layers to its characters. Belle has more agency in ways big and small – she's the one in control even when she (voluntarily) becomes the Beast's prisoner and, in a small but important scene, she shares the gift of independent thinking by teaching a village girl how to read.\\n\\nSimilarly, the many relationships in the film are given welcome depth. Belle and the Beast find common ground in books and feeling out-of-place, even in the places they call home. We're furnished with hints as to why the household servants – including suave candlestick Lumiere (Ewan McGregor), jittery clock Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) and motherly kettle Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) – are more invested in breaking the curse that befell them. LeFou's (Josh Gad) devotion to the pompous Gaston (Luke Evans) goes, quite logically, from subtext to text, though in a way that hardly warrants the firestorm of controversy that has erupted in conservative circles over Disney's 'gay agenda'.\\n\\nThat said, other aspects of this remake yield more mixed results. The Beast's very real, very human eyes provide emotional connection and depth in a way that animation can't fully approximate. But burying Stevens beneath layers of CGI and prosthetics also means that the Beast can occasionally come across as a stiff, oversized teddy bear, lacking the fluidity of expression of his animated counterpart. The same goes for the household servants: ironically, efforts to make them more 'realistic' end up bleeding them of life and personality.\\n\\nIt's the same story with the film's music. Some of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's iconic original numbers are thoughtfully re- imagined: 'Be Our Guest' is a joyous explosion of camp colour, featuring welcome nods to movies like Cabaret and Singin' In The Rain; and 'Gaston' morphs into a lively bar-storming number that practically demands applause at the end.\\n\\nBut the new songs, penned by Menken and Tim Rice, are more nice than necessary. 'How Does A Moment Last Forever' is lovely but lacks impact. 'Evermore' – a new anthem for the Beast – will no doubt become a cabaret standard but is badly served in the context of the film: it feels overwrought and a bit silly, lessening rather than heightening the dramatic tension at that particular moment.\\n\\nPerformances across the board are good, as you would expect from a cast of this calibre – though it's hard not to wish for accomplished performers like Thompson, McKellen and Broadway legend Audra McDonald (playing the part of an operatic, narcoleptic wardrobe) to be better served by both script and special effects. Watson, who has proved a better advocate than actor in recent years, is a perfectly credible (though hardly riveting) Belle. Stevens does a decent job with a challenging part, while Evans convincingly conjures up both swagger and menace.\\n\\nIt's evident in every frame that everyone involved in Beauty And The Beast worked mightily hard to prove that transforming one of Disney's most iconic movies into a live-action extravaganza is worth the effort. They don't always pull it off: the film gets about as many things wrong as it does right, and it most certainly doesn't surpass the animated classic in quality. But it tells a familiar tale well enough – enough, one suspects, to win over fans old and new.\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '10/10', 'title': 'Best Sequel yet', 'movie_id': '1745960', 'author': 'GusherPop25', 'date': 'May 2022', 'content': 'In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, \"Son, your ego\\'s writing checks your body can\\'t cash.\" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he\\'s as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he\\'s ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise\\'s regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They\\'re tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, \"Hold My Hand.\" It\\'s nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie\\'s \"Take My Breath Away,\" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you\\'re really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that\\'s because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he\\'s trying to show us that there\\'s room for the old and the new to coexist. He\\'s also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.'}\n",

I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.\\n\\nThe story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.\\n\\nTom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' (unexplained) absence.\\n\\nMonica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.\\n\\nA great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.\"}\n",

This is why I LOVE Tom Cruise Post-Mid-1992. Aside from the RARE misfire, cough, cough, The Mummy, when Tom Cruise wants a movie to be better than perfect, he pushes it past Mach 10.\\n\\nThe first half of this adventure made me feel this is the perfect and worthy sequel to the original. AND THEN...the second half kicked in thoroughly SURPASSING the original by a landslide. Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that\\'s lightning that can\\'t be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.\\n\\nMaverick never changed. And just went he was about to use up his seemingly endless supply of luck, he got recruited back into the \"Top Gun\" division to get the elite ready for a, dare I?, almost Impossible Mission. Oh, and there\\'s a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.\\n\\nWhat matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it\\'s WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.\\n\\nWhile the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn\\'t all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they\\'re learning to be the best. And they may someday.\\n\\nThe movie\\'s music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.\\n\\nIf you loved the first one, there\\'s virtually no way you wouldn\\'t love this even more. It\\'s absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it\\'s also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.\\n\\nAnd to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky. Here, they make sure no one is left in the dust.\\n\\nI can\\'t recommend this movie enough and to see it in theatres, preferably a Dolby-certified one. Don\\'t wait for Paramount+ to pick this up (like I normally would.) Go see this now on the big screen as it should be seen and don\\'t miss out like I did with the original in 1986.\\n\\n***\\n\\nFinal Thoughts: I *just* made my Top Ten Tom Cruise movie list, time to update it:\\n\\n1.

I am writing this with that in mind. Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.\\n\\nThere are quite a few connections to the first movie, but there is also nods to real life. Especially with Val Kilmer in mind. And all is serving the story - even the real life struggle Kilmer has, that gets woven into the character Iceman. So there are two of the big stars of the first one name checked - what about Kelly McGillis though? Well don\\'t hold your breath (it is being taken away, sorry for the pun)! She is not returning. Now you could be mad at the movie for that - or you could salute it for bringing \"back\" a character that was only name checked in the first movie - and being played by the wonderful Jennifer Connely.\\n\\nNow is she as beautiful as ever? Yes. But she is also close to the age of Tom Cruise that some other names could have been. Of course do not overthink the age thing, because you\\'d find that her real age would have been inappropriate during the time of the first movie ... just saying. Again: do not overthink it at all.\\n\\nThose things out of the way, we get introduced to a whole bunch of new characters. There probably is not as much ... well male on male energy here as there was in the first one. Even in the dialog - you just feel it. Don\\'t give me that look (and yes I know it is the only one you\\'ve got - especially when I bring the puns)! There is more than a coherent story - and the movie takes its time to tell it. There is plenty of action too.\\n\\nThere is also technical talk that I didn\\'t totally understand. But it is not necessary to get the movie or enjoy it. And then there is the ending - and what a perfect ending this has. So much so, that I decided it deserves the 10 rating I finally gave it. It may copy many things from the first movie (call it homage), especially the intro but also some story beats, but it still stands ... or rather flies on its own! Just buckle your seatbelt, because you may get dizzy.\\n\\nFirst time watching I could spot the music cues from the first one, but there were also some fresh elements to it. If I didn\\'t know Lady Gaga was at least partly (big parts if I understood correctly) responsible for the soundtrack, I wouldn\\'t have guessed myself to be honest. As it is, one of the biggest highlights in cinemas this year - the waiting was worth it. If you feel the need .. the need for speed - your need will be satisfied here (or rather in cinemas). Even being able to predict story points will not take away anything from the experience you can have with this. Enjoy.'}\n",

It delivers light, simple and sweet entertainment in a delicious mix of action, drama, some romance and humor in a delightful manner.\\n\\nTom Cruise shines in his performance where he is required to display a good range of emotions and has a good chemistry with Jennifer Connelly, while also impressing us in the action sequences as he always does. Speak of which, the action is very beautifully executed as well as filmed. Every time the jets turned, I felt like my head moved along in the same direction. This effect is repeated multiple times and ends up immersing the viewer into the thrill of the action. It's very clean and neatly done, and never violent at all. The film has no adult content, due to which you can watch it with your families.\\n\\nThe music and score are terrific, and the cinematography is another major plus. Some might find the initial few acts a little slow, but the action sequences completely steal the show, especially in the lengthy and spellbinding final act. The editing is top notch, as the film never feels long or stretched. I was actually surprised how short it felt, and in a good way. Top Gun: Maverick is a very feel-good action movie with realistic action and emotions to deliver an experience of a lifetime. If you enjoyed Top Gun, chances are you will find yourself loving this film even more, for Cruise once again proves he's the man to look for when quality action is what viewers crave. Must watch on the big screen. Period.\"}\n",

I saw it like 5 years ago so for me it wasn\\'t nostalic or anything. It was just OK movie and nothing more.\\n\\nToday i saw \"Top Gun: Maverick\" (2022) in cinema. And it blew me away. This movie was incredible. It literally put a smile on my face. Action scenes in the air were the best i ever saw of this type of action. Directing by Joseph Kosinski was perfect. Music was on spot. Cinematography was gorgeous. I loved how actually calm and quite this movie was, until it wasn\\'t and transition between scenes, acts, calm and action was perfect. Acting was great. This is a movie making as good as it gets. Was it predictable? Yes. But at the same time i was excited and glued to the screen during its whole 2 hours run time.\\n\\nOverall, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is a Hollywood blockbuster done right. Its a Hollywood action adventure movie in every possible way, yet this time its done incredibly good. What a terrific sequel.'}\n",

Top Gun: Maverick deserves so much for how practical everything is. Great the IMDb rating is 8.7 hope it stays high, should even get awards. The music hit the spot, cinematography is beautiful, the story flow well, and the acting is incredible so much so that even though Val Kilmer has mouth cancer in real life he has a small part in the film.

This movie uses the exact same formula as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it remakes the original film almost scene for scene and adds a few new bits. Both films treating the audience with a little bit of contempt whilst cashing in on the nostalgia market.\\n\\nHaving said that, its a fun movie. Teller, as Goose 2.0, works particularly well.

But I now get it., its the nostalgia for the first film that fuels the scores for this film.\\n\\nHere is my take and why I think its an \"okay\" film, just not a great one. There really isn\\'t a whole lot of meat and potatoes to this story. It\\'s largely a copy pasta in large chunks from the older film but with newer, younger faces. Maverick is charged with training a squadron of top gun fighter pilots to destroy an enemy uranium enrichment plant that is about to come online and operational. But it seems the producers want to maximize the profits for this film and not offend anyone in the real world. So this enemy doesn\\'t have a name or a geographical location. The enemy has 5th generation fighter jets and some James Bond evil villian sized SAM batteries around the mountain\\'s summit. It is a snow covered terrain so that rules out many enemies in warmer climates.\\n\\nThen there is the lone aircraft carrier delivering these jet fighters to the enemies doorstep. Well, by now most people know that wouldn\\'t be the case. Carriers are heavily guarded and their presence would trigger the attention of any adversary. No way could four F18 sneak in under radar to blow up this plant unless we accept the enemy isn\\'t aware of a huge freakin carrier of their shores. So there is nothing resembling a realistic scenario and that kept me from enjoying the story too much.\\n\\nThe romantic relationship in the film has no chemistry. I just didn\\'t feel any chemistry between Penny and Maverick. That\\'s a first because you do have two very good looking actors and I always thought Tom Cruise to be great action actor. So no chemistry between Cruise and Jennifer Connelly is a bitter pill to swallow.\\n\\nWhat I did like about it was the cinematography and some of the action sequences with the dog fighting. But I didn\\'t think the dog fighting were any better than the original film. In fact, the original film might have had better scenes. This film just has a lot of choppy editing to imply action.\\n\\nI think its a 6/10, but not a chance it\\'s a 9/10. Maybe if they added a Tom Clancy inspired screenplay to the film I might have given it a 9. Maybe a team of seals to do recon before having the jets engage and with the aircraft carrier companied by a battlegroup flotilla. Aircraft Carriers just don\\'t end up secretly off the shore of adversarial country completely alone, not in the real world.'}\n",

What I got was a huge pile of corn. If not for the flying sequences, which are awesome, the rest of the movie is a bit pants. Ed Harris is in it for a single scene, more of a cameo role than anything. Val Kilmer's scene was embarrassing. Jennifer Connelly is looking her age and plays a half baked love interest which frankly the film could have done without. Is she supposed to be the Kelly McGillis role from the original movie? She lives in a very similar house and she drives a Porsche so who knows? The plot revolves around a mission so uniquely unlikely that it makes the movie slightly preposterous. The cast of pilots don't hold a candle to the original cast and their characters are two dimensional and boring. It isn't Tom Cruise's best performance either playing the eponymous Maverick, a man still plagued by the death of his buddy, Goose from the first movie. Come on, man. That was 35 years ago, get over it FFS! Jon Hamm, who I normally like doesn't look comfortable playing Maverick's up tight commander and there's a scene of beach football which is supposed to mirror the volleyball scene from the first movie but just looks gay AF. Once again the flying scenes are unbelievable, by that I mean extremely believable. The actors must have actually been in the planes for at least some of the shots and CGI has been kept to a minimum which is great to see. But take away those sequences, which don't account for much run time, maybe 15% of total run time, and what you have left is quite poor.\"}\n",

It has great looking effects, but it's only there to hide the fact that once you look past all the superficial razzle dazzle to hide the mess underneath.

We learn from the opening text crawl that in the absence of Luke Skywalker, the sinister First Order has risen into power led by the menacing Kylo Ren(Adam Driver), who is on the hunt for the last Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. He is introduced into the film in an explosive sequence setting the tone for the remainder of the film. Driver brings a lot of raw emotion to the part of Ren, who's being tormented by his feelings, and lure to the Light and Dark side. During the opening scene Ren comes into contact with newcomer Poe Dameron(Oscar Issac) a rebel fighter pilot regarded as the best in the resistance. Who is handed a vital piece of information, that could lead to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker, and thus sets off a chain of events bringing in old and new characters alike. Issac brings a-lot of likability as Poe to the film, and was reminiscent of Han Solo(Harrison Ford) In the original trilogy. Whilst on the Planet of Jakku we're introduced to Finn(John Boyega) a disillusioned stormtrooper, who wants out of the First Order. Boyega plays the part with a lot enthusiasm, and joy he brings a lot of laughs to the story whilst maintaining his own dramatic moments through out the story. He eventually comes into contact with a scavenger named Rey(Daisy Ridley) on the planet Jakku. Who struggles to make a living finding scraps/relics for food, she is also torn between waiting for her family to come back, and realising that her journey is much more then salvaging parts, when She crosses paths with Finn and a lovable new droid named BB8. After a thrilling escape from the First Order our heroes come across veterans of the original series Han Solo(Ford) and the Wookie Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew). Ford does a good job of tying the mythos of the original trilogy, and connecting us with the newcomers, without ever leaving old viewers feeling cold and new viewers guessing as too what is happening.\\n\\nFrom the moment the film begins it maintains a breakneck pace, that hardly allows the viewer to stop and reflect what's happening with the plot of the film, which Is a good thing, because there are a-lot of plot holes In the film. We are also given enough information sprinkled throughout the film so that all the new characters feel fleshed out enough, to make us care about them.\\n\\nThe film spends most of the first half on a desert planet named Jakku, The cinematography Is beautiful to look at, the screen Is filled with sweeping landscapes that gives the world a vast feeling of isolation and hopelessness. Disney brought In director JJ Abrams, who recently came off of rebooting the successful Star Trek franchise. He's the perfect choice to re-invigorate this franchise, his use of practical effects give this film a weight that all the prequels were sorely missing. We feel the size and scope of Starkiller Base, the heaviness of the Lightsabers, you feel the impact of the blaster rifles. The use of real locations and sets also give the film a-lot of natural colour which bursts onto the screen. Where-as the prequel trilogy which was all shot on digital, and Used a lot of CGI characters and effects. CGI in the film is used to a minimum and only used when needed. There were however a couple of characters, Unkar Plutt and Maz Kanata which felt like they could of been done better. In a couple scenes they look out place when surrounded by practical effects and actors in costumes and make up. Overall the film is visually stunning to look at because of this it gives the film(and series) a fresh vibrancy that has been lacking since Return of the Jedi. There are also just the right amount of callbacks, without it becoming crowd-pleasing, there is a plenty of nostalgia and references to the original films that fans of the series will recognise. John Williams also creates a new score with him that feels a little lacklustre when compared to original and prequel films. The only memorable theme being Kylo Rens.\\n\\nThere were on the other hand certain aspects of the film which felt like it was treading old water from A New Hope, especially Starkiller Base, which is essentially a third Deathstar that feels like it's only part of the film so there's a third act, for all our heroes too band together and fight. It's hard not too notice certain similarities from the A New Hope, and at times feels like It's been done to play things safe after the backlash of the Prequels. The film is also filled a lot of humorous moments as-well, which helps to lighten up some of the darker aspects of the film, although not every joke hits the mark, and occasionally they feel out of place, especially during the the last act of the film.\\n\\nStar Wars the: The Force Awakens is filled with excellent set pieces which immerses the audience back into the universe. We're given enough plot information, and character development to draw us into the the new generation of characters. Whilst some areas feel familiar, there Is a lot too love about this film, watching this In the Cinema was an Incredibly exciting and engaging experience, which had me feeling like a kid watching the original films for the first time and being swept away into a galaxy far, far away. This film has resurrected the Star Wars franchise, and made it one of the must see film experiences of the year.\"}\n",

Even if it's for only two hours, I like to occasionally escape this often unfair world we all live in and lose myself in a fictional adventure. And I think I speak for both the young and the young at heart when I say that Star Wars has brought escapism to audiences all over the globe and for many generations over the past 40 years.\\n\\nI was born in the mid 1990s, so I never had a chance to experience the original Star Wars trilogy on the big screen and this was something that I had a hard time accepting ever since I was a child. I never thought I would be able to see Luke Skywalker, Han Solo or Princess Leia on the big screen ever in my life time. So you can imagine my excitement when I found out that they were making another Star Wars film that was not only inventing an entirely new cast of fresh faced characters, but was also bringing back the cast from the original films, who that of which have not walked on a Star Wars set for over 30 years. So it brings me great delight to be able to tell you that the most recent installment in the franchise did not disappoint.\\n\\nThe new characters of the film are all fully developed and come with their own strengths and insecurities. They don't clash with the old cast, but instead melt beautifully with them in every scene. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all do amazingly well. The old cast of course are all stellar too. They slipped back into their respected characters so seamlessly, it feels as though no time has passed at all.\\n\\nI was already familiar with J.J Abrams directing style going into this film. He, once again...does not fail to impress. This film is rife with stunning cinematography. The various locations are as gorgeous as they are aesthetically pleasing. CGI is used in this film, but to my relief it does not overpower the organic and practical effects. The environment in which these characters are staged in feels so authentic and believable, you feel as though you are a part of the journey yourself. It's instantly apparent that this film was made by a man who loves Star Wars just as much as we do.\\n\\nOverall, the film is a triumph. It's a wonderful collaboration of new and old filming techniques that combine beautifully to create the ultimate Star Wars film that everyone can enjoy. It doesn't matter if this is your first experience with the Star Wars saga, or if you've watched all of the films one hundred times over, fans both new and familiar will equally appreciate the love and care that was tirelessly thrown into this dazzling, epic adventure. I anxiously await the next installment.\"}\n",

From the first frame you're sucked right back into the Star Wars universe, and that's probably the best part of the movie - it feels genuinely like Star Wars. Not a child-pandering political farce (The Phantom Menace), a melodramatic soap opera (I'm looking at you Attack of the Clones) or a CGI filled sensory overload (Revenge of the Sith anyone?). No, it's barebones Star Wars. Visually stunning, constantly engaging, and most of all, it's incredibly fun. There are a lot of parallels with A New Hope, like how we're beginning this epic adventure with vastly different characters and learning their stories for the first time. And it shares the basic outline of that movie as well from the monumental opening shot to its massive riveting climax. It's a blast from beginning to end, and especially exhilarating in a packed IMAX theater.\\n\\nThe characters are easily relatable from the moment they're shown. Their stories are simple and to the point, allowing the audience to follow them in their journey every step of the way. There's also a lot of humor in the movie, and not the dopey kind either. It's clever and self-referential humor that suits the characters and their motivations while also being damn funny in context.\\n\\nIt's hard to put this into words because if you're a fan, you're well aware that watching Star Wars is an experience. There's a rush of being back in the universe and seeing some of your favorite characters again. The threats are even bigger this time around. The First Order is what the Empire has become, led by Supreme Leader Snoke and his apprentice Kylo Ren. At first glance Kylo might seem like a second-rate Vader, but he has much more depth than that. Things are revealed in the movie that piece everything together, and when all is said and done, Kylo Ren is not only a great villain but a great character - charismatic but insecure, arrogant but unexperienced. You can empathize with him at times, but it's obvious there's great darkness within him, and not only because of his haunting mask. The heroes Rey and Finn are immediately likable and easy to root for, and when they start uncovering the bigger picture behind the First Order's sinister plot, they behave exactly as you'd expect them to. Not pompous or valiant but hesitant and curious, at least until their lives are on the line and the only way for them to survive is to band together. Then their inner heroism comes to light.\\n\\nEverything about The Force Awakens is phenomenal - the acting, directing, and writing are all on point, and it serves as a wonderful template for this new Star Wars era. I don't need to spoil anything because the fact is, if you loved the original trilogy you're going to love this. Hell, if you're a fan of good cinema you should love this. Episode VII is what Star Wars fans have been yearning for, and when all is said and done, I couldn't ask for anything more.\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '9/10', 'title': 'Something, something, something, Dark Side. Something, something, something, complete', 'movie_id': '2488496', 'author': 'Chalice_Of_Evil16', 'date': 'December 2015', 'content': 'It\\'s as if millions of Star Wars fans suddenly cried out in criticism and were suddenly silenced. That\\'s the effect this movie *should* have on most (other than those who\\'d already decided they were going to be disappointed/hate it no matter what). For all the SANE Star Wars fans out there, I\\'m happy to report that the Force is strong with this series once again (after taking a walk on the Dark Side with the prequels). All other shoddy imitations take note: THIS is how you do a space opera. The Force Awakens possesses everything that was missing from the soulless prequels: we have a non-snooze-worthy storyline, likable new characters, great acting, non-cringe-worthy dialogue and not such a reliance on only CGI effects/green-screen. The pluses of this movie are in abundance, starting with what\\'s new. All those with reservations about the fresh young actors cast to play new characters Rey and Finn should sit back, relax and watch the beautiful chemistry between the two as their characters form a believable friendship/dynamic on screen like that of the Original Trilogy\\'s trio.\\n\\nDaisy Ridley more than proves she\\'s up to the challenge of having a large portion of the new trilogy rest on her shoulders. Rey is a scavenger with a good heart (as evidenced by her rescuing BB-8, a droid carrying something important). Whilst certain people (who for some unfathomable reason don\\'t like seeing a woman who can handle herself) may take this new female lead (who is smart, brave, kind and just all around awesome) as a personal affront to them, for the rest of us who *don\\'t* hate seeing a woman take centre stage, this is what we\\'ve been looking for in a female character for so long. She\\'s everything you could hope for, but not without her faults, as she does make some mistakes (but not enough to hate her for it). She\\'s flawed, but much more interesting because of this. Ridley imbues her character with so much heart/soul, she conveys a lot with just looks and even proves adept at humour as well. Most importantly, she\\'s *likable*, forming instant friendships with other characters who we already like (so we know she\\'s awesome). Any gripes about her would be nitpicky/for petty reasons.\\n\\nSharing Ridley\\'s responsibility as one of the new faces of this trilogy is John Boyega as Finn, a former Stormtrooper who refuses to go along with the rest in doing something terrible. It\\'s after this that he meets Oscar Isaac\\'s Poe Dameron, who he forms an almost-immediate friendship with. Out of the three new leads, Isaac\\'s Poe is probably given the least development, but he manages to make it believable that he and Finn become close friends in such a short time. The best dynamic, though, is without a doubt the one formed between Rey and Finn. The way they play off each other with such ease is, in large part, thanks to the actors, but also the dialogue being snappy/quick-witted. They share a fun friendship, becoming quite close, and the actors\\' enthusiasm/energy helps a lot, as they\\'re truly inhabiting their roles/believing in who they\\'re playing as well as the universe they\\'re a part of (where characters talk/act in a unique way). One of many things the prequels sadly lacked was heart, but this movie/these characters have it in spades.\\n\\nAdam Driver\\'s Kylo Ren picks up where Darth Vader left off as our main villain and is clearly devoted to his memory (since he talks to his burned mask). Driver is quite good at playing the bad guy, though he is prone to the occasional \\'hissy fit\\' with his crossguard lightsaber which verges into slightly over-the-top/petulant teenager behavior. Thankfully, when the big moments occur, Driver shows real emotion/conflict within his character. His lightsaber duel, first with Finn and then Rey, is everything the over-choreographed prequel duels were lacking. They may\\'ve had the needless fancy twirling and whatnot, but here we have rough and tumble, gritty fights between someone skilled and two people who are only just learning what they\\'re capable of. Plus there\\'s real emotional investment, which helps. It\\'s an epic tension-filled battle, which is a BIG plus with this movie, as we don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen.\\n\\nNaturally, it\\'s good to see our old favourites back (Han, Chewie, Leia, R2-D2, C-3PO, even the Millennium Falcon, all of which received applause at my screening). Those claiming this film relies on nostalgia/good will towards the original films alone are mistaken. Whilst the prequels included familiar characters/moments just for the sake of callbacks, what they do here is much more satisfying. Han is his usual charming, funny, \"scruffy-looking nerf-herder\" self, but he forms attachments to our new characters, and his dynamics with them allows for some of the film\\'s best moments. The movie certainly has humour, but thankfully it\\'s not the \"cutsie\" nauseating variety found in the prequels. There are genuinely funny moments for young and old alike.\\n\\nJ.J. Abrams has been unfairly criticised, when he should be receiving thanks. He had the unenviable task of reinvigorating/re-energising the franchise after the prequels nearly killed it and has managed to do so successfully. So what if there\\'s some familiarity? My only quibbles were Domhnall Gleeson\\'s shouty performance and Andy Serkis\\' CGI Supreme Leader Snoke. In most other instances, Abrams ensured that, along with story/character development, locations/miniatures/practical effects/make-up took precedence over a reliance on CGI/things that simply \\'looked cool\\'. Some familiar musical themes appear on the score, but there are also some new ones which I appreciated were more restrained and not so \\'in-your-face\\' as certain popular themes introduced in the prequels. There is also an abundance of excellent shots throughout the movie; quite a few are instantly iconic. It would be quite the feat for the following films to match this thrilling/exciting and enjoyable/satisfying first chapter of a new era in the saga. If nothing else, at least The Force Awakens easily beats The Phantom Menace in being a great start to a new trilogy of films.'}\n",

But after Lucas received flak for ethnic portrayal, Jar-Jar became boring in Star Wars 2. In Star Wars 7, this pandering becomes intolerable. It\\'s fine that Leah has the force, and it\\'s fine that Rey inherited it, but Finn is gratuitous in his race. I would have nothing against this either but they make Finn formidable with a light-sabre against Kylo Ren. And please don\\'t soft-soap me that love gave Finn the strength and skill to take on a pupil of the force - only hate has that power, the dark side. Otherwise, one must be cool and focused. Given this, I dismiss Finn and therefore it irritated me to watch Kylo Ren sword-play with Finn and not simply crush his windpipe with a wave of his hand, or penetrate his mind, which seems to be Ren\\'s forte. As for Kylo vs. Rey, a bit more believable, but it made Kylo seem almost inept. Really? Rey\\'s raw ability with zero training is tougher than Kylo with training? Not even close to believable.\\n\\nWhat didn\\'t I like about the plot? Well, first, aren\\'t we simply replaying Death Star destruction from the first trilogy? Why, yes we are. And it looks like the Supreme Leader made all the same engineering, logistic, and tactical errors as the Emperor, just on a grander scale, including the convenient \"having to recharge the cannon\" just long enough for the Resistance to \"win the day.\" Yawn. Second, much of the plot was geared to exploit the Skywalker/Solo family tree, and there was no thrill to any of it. Darth Vader is Luke\\'s father - WHOA! I jumped out of my seat. Han is Kylo\\'s father? Zzzz. Even if you wanted to say this was a remake, which it\\'s not, it doesn\\'t have the pizazz, never mind the oomph, of the original. But what does?\\n\\nBut the acting is where I think I really blew my cool. I can understand characters of convenience, and plot-lines of olde being rehashed, but it has to be acted well to pull it off. Even in Star Wars 3, as sappy as it was, the acting was GREAT, IMO. In Star Wars 7, Harrison Ford is just about limping to his finale, Carrie Fisher looks doddering and not commanding, Daisy Ridley grits her teeth so often I thought she was Red Sonja, John Boyega makes a concerted effort to appear naive at every turn (which makes his good fortune all the more unbearable), Adam Driver does not look torn in the least, and so forth.\\n\\nI can point to hundreds of interesting and thrilling moments from the first six episodes of Star Wars which makes a complete weekend binge-watch, over and over again. Star Wars 7 does not add to that excitement. The tech seems standard, the CGI a little too self-conscious, the nostalgic cheese forced, the push forward too bossy and not natural. Still, I give this film a 6 in the hopes that Star Wars 8 will push the envelope once again.'}\n",

      "{'ratings': '9/10', 'title': 'The force has awakened!', 'movie_id': '2488496', 'author': 'TheLittleSongbird1', 'date': 'August 2017', 'content': \"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'.\\n\\nDespite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes.\\n\\n'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time.\\n\\nWhile it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified).\\n\\nThe story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question.\\n\\nCould the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time.\\n\\nVisually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy.\\n\\nActing also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance.\\n\\nIn conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany Cox\"}\n",

The Force Awakens look, feels and sounds like the real Star Wars movie. It contains all the elements that made the original story so epic. It tells an epic story with great scenery and with fine action and adventure. The Force Awakens is like a reboot of an original story, but the same time it is clearly continuation to an original saga. The story and characters are written well. Actors and actresses get through greatly at their roles. No one feels lame or factitious. The story is clearly a tribute to Han Solo, but at the same time it brings new characters well present. Maybe only one thing is not perfect. The story serves background stories of some characters almost too easily and dish out them with no big surprise which made the original movie so epic. The original story was actually a soap opera of one family. There are some elements in this story too, but they are reveled almost too easily. Greatly the story leaves enough of loose ends, so probably we will get bigger surprises of the characters later at upcoming movies.\\n\\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens is loyal to its fans and it lacks of prequels plastic look. It looks familiar, but at a same time it is fresh and interesting. Iconic characters are brought back honorably, but at a same time it tells a new story with new characters. It offer a nostalgic and new epic adventure at same package. Great script offers enough of action and adventure. It almost feels like George Lucas says: \"This is what the Star Wars meant to be\".\\n\\nJ.J. Abrams manages to refresh Star Wars saga to present day without forgetting the original fans. It almost feels like I was again that 12 year old boy at 1977, who watched the original story 13 times in two weeks.\\n\\nI watched this movie first time in 2D, but I will watch it again and next time I will see it at 3D, so I will add later to this review how 3D worked in this movie.'}\n",

Every Star Wars Fans will enjoy the scenery of a defunct Star Destroyer in the desert, but overall cinematography and scenery is in fact the best of all the Star Wars by its beauty and diversity. We get sultry desert in Jakku like Tatooine and forest like Endor. We get beautiful snow that surpass Hoth, buildings and water like Naboo and idyllic Irish-like islands. Daniel Mindel is the cinematographer who also did marvels with JJ on the first 2 Star Trek reboots. Every battle scene is sweeping and spectacular with many elements, motion and emotion. Humour is effective and tension is well crafted and augmented by sound, music and editing.\\n\\nHere Abrams outdoes himself by keeping it crisp with new likable and believable characters, great acting and superb directing to keep everything flowing and fans following. We feel for the characters, old and new. We are intrigued and we do not want it to end. A pretty much perfect movie of the genre and for a new generation, with Rey a particular stand-out.\\n\\nHan and Leia were not only there for older fans, but make it work as very important elements to the story. The writing and directing for them is just right, like the rest of the movie.\\n\\nAward-worthy, action-packed, well-paced, high expectations delivered and then some.\\n\\nIt\\'s decisively the best Star Wars yet, and that is no small feat.

I\\'m baffled by how little focus is on dinosaurs. And I don\\'t just mean they are barely onscreen. The original Jurassic Park barely had any for the first hour. But everything leading up to that, the story, dialogue and themes, were all focused on dinosaurs.\\n\\nThat\\'s not the case with Dominion. The majority of the storylines are tangentially related at best, completely unrelated at worst. Imagine watching Taken but Liam Neeson has to watch out for dinosaurs... that\\'s one storyline. You could replace dinosaurs with any scary creatures and it would make little difference to the plot.\\n\\nOn top of that, they did a poor job of balancing so many storylines with different characters. Or maybe it\\'s because every single one is uninteresting. And the moment when the different characters come together falls completely flat. I compare it to Stranger Things, when the stories converge and the crew is finally together, those moments are so impactful and exciting. They feel earned and elevate everything after. In Dominion, you don\\'t feel any kind of magic.\\n\\nSome parts were so bad they made me cringe or roll my eyes. But that wasn\\'t the case for the majority of the movie. So why such a harsh score? Because this movie, which is the definition of a popcorn flick here to entertain us, is unbelievably boring. I had 8 hours of sleep last night and drank a Red Bull, yet I was struggling to stay awake. I had to un-recline.\\n\\nAll of the action scenes are forgettable. Literally. It\\'s only been a few hours and I can remember maybe a couple cool moments. And one thing I couldn\\'t believe, the climax action sequence is straight-up copied from one of the previous movies. I won\\'t say which one, but I\\'m baffled they went this route. It\\'s even sadder when you realize it\\'s worse than what it copied in every way.\\n\\nAs for the dinosaur effects, at times the animatronic dinosaurs look like toys. And the CGI dinosaurs look a bit off. I don\\'t think it\\'s poor CGI but something about it doesn\\'t feel right.\\n\\nI am so disappointed this is what they gave us for their self-proclaimed \"epic conclusion of the Jurassic era.\" Especially after Fallen Kingdom left us with such an exciting cliffhanger, the chaos that awaits the people of the world when dinosaurs are unleashed upon them. That\\'s not at all what we get.\\n\\nI loved the first Jurassic World. And while the second is highly flawed, it\\'s still entertaining and filled with tension and suspense.

From the opening island scene with the brachiosaurus to the T-Rex reveal in the rainstorm, dinosaurs were front and center in the original Jurassic Park, inspiring a sense of grandeur and awe. The dinosaurs were what mattered, and everything else was peripheral-even the plot to get off the island. We all wanted another glimpse of the T-Rex, or were anxious to discover where the raptors were lurking.\\n\\nSo that was the first one. Now in this sixth installment, not only are dinosaurs relegated to a commercialized product that's seen on every tv screen in the movie, but they're demoted below the humans, genetics, and even mutated locusts in terms of importance. In a two and a half hour movie, one would expect dinosaurs to fill almost half that time, and yet they pale in screen time comparison to all the human characters. Instead, the director tried to insert cameos of the legacy characters in forced interactions and honestly cringey dialogue, shifting the focus away from the real meaning in the Jurassic Park franchise-awe for dinosaurs. The wonder is now gone.\\n\\nI have given it six stars in respect for the franchise and the limited appearances of some of my favorite dinosaurs, but I'm sad to see that the director forgot what made Jurassic Park so special in the first place.\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '4/10', 'title': 'Wayne Knight said it best three decades ago: We got Dodgson here, and nobody cares.', 'movie_id': '8041270', 'author': 'Brandon_Walker_Robinson8', 'date': 'June 2022', 'content': \"I don't know whether this is a fabled memory, but a few years ago I think I read an interview where director Colin Trevorrow said that the story of Dominion was always his ultimate go-to, that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were the stepping stones to there (almost as if it was gathering the right build-up with characters, fan anticipation, budget, and technological advances). For every reason imaginable, I believed him. Where Fallen Kingdom ended, you had endless opportunity to explore the world with dinosaurs running amok and causing mayhem. Final shots of Fallen Kingdom included the T-Rex at a zoo, the Mosasaurus attacking surfers, a velociraptor overlooking a suburban California, and pterodactyls towering above a tourist-populated Las Vegas. It was all there; think The Lost World's San Diego epilogue but on a grander scale with more dinosaurs. Throw in the military, philosophical conversations regarding their eradication versus their survival, advance some more characters, and you have a bona fide fun summer blockbuster.\\n\\nThis didn't happen.\\n\\nNo matter what my actual opinion is of the film hereon out, I can't help but be letdown with disappointment that Trevorrow either deluded himself into believing this was the kind of conclusion that fans yearned for ala War for the Planet of the Apes (which has a much more compelling protagonist that makes it work despite its story misdirection) or J. A. Bayona pulled a Rian Johnson and put him in a corner with the concluding chapter that he had to rectify and had no actual written plan of his own. And it's not that there isn't a medium where this story doesn't work just fine. I can imagine the main plot elements being adapted from, say, a novelization or a comic series. Hell, there was even that Battle at Big Rock short that was done which could have told these elements on their own, or at the very least introduced them. Instead, they threw in extremely disjointed story bits for this final chapter that seemed to have no source of origin. They felt like they were the contrivance meant to unite our two character groups, and nothing more.\\n\\nDominion starts off very okay. It shows that it can slow down, have a genuine heartbeat, provide pathos for the existence of our reptilian brethren, trot the globe to see how they have integrated (or not) with our species, and reintroduce characters new and old (with possible internal conflicts) to show how they would pave their globetrotting paths. They even fix some of the poorly written aspects of Fallen Kingdom such as maturing Franklin's character, giving better use to the laser-targeting attack system, and giving Maisie a more believable backstory. All of this is supported with fantastic animatronic work and much improved CGI blending with it. I thought the visuals were mostly a knockout and supported the onscreen setups.\\n\\nNot only that, but Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum kindled a similar flame to their interactions in JP1 and you sat forward to watch those moments. I caught myself smiling quite a few times during those exchanges. Jeff Goldblum was especially used well as he was able to inject entertainment and comedy through his dialogue where the film otherwise was flat with on its attempts. They were not small cameo appearances and served crucial roles to the film. You buy where they are in their lives, and even though TLW and JP3 are retconned the actors clearly tapped into those experiences for their performances to accentuate their statuses.\\n\\nSpeaking of buy-in, I would have given this film a long leash on a lot of things they could have done or did with this movie. We hit the point where we can embrace the ridiculous in several places. Want to make Blue become Owen's pet and attack guard? Go right on ahead. Want to modernize the action and give our protagonists more ability and skill that you might see in the Fast & Furious franchise or with our human Marvel heroes? If the dinosaurs get their large share of the action as well, I'm on board (the Malta scene is a perfect example of this). Want to pay homage to the previous films as you conclude your franchise? That is what I expect. I also expect them to diversify this on a tonal level where need be as to not become too stale, and I think I was feeling that here. Hell, there is nearly a half-hour duration where not a single dinosaur is shown or brought up, and if it's in anticipation for what is to come while building character or story then I will let it play out.\\n\\nThe problem really arose both when the movie decided to abandon the broad, peregrinating experience and confine its setting. Dominion is the saga's epic conclusion and did not need to put on this hat. This was a major rug pull from what was anticipated, and soured itself spending an excruciatingly long time on something that left little entertainment, tension, or dinosaurs. When they do show up, the moments become a little one-note. Our good guys have plot armor such as raptors that can run at vehicle speeds but can't catch up to running characters, or when they are cornered they just get roared at or ran/flown/swam past until they find their way out of the situation, or when they know they can stand around and trust that a carnivore won't eat them because reasons. Bryce Dallas Howard got the best/most suspenseful dino encounters at this stage of the film and they actually work extremely well, but for a near 150-minute movie these are few and far between, and for this franchise you really have to sit and ask yourself if there is a chance that she won't survive any of these instances.\\n\\nA lot of this could have been made better if our Rexy got some great moments, but even she was backdropped and upstaged too often to matter, or when she does come on screen it seems to be a rehashed occurrence from something of old. She looked and sounded good, though. I want to restate how good the dinosaurs actually looked here, and I want to commend the visual effects departments for what they were able to do in that department. If there was a niggle I'd have here, it would probably be in the weight of the raptor movement which felt too light and jittery. That probably only makes sense in my head, but the rest looked really good. If knowing that I would have to wait 21 years after 2001's Jurassic Park III to finally get the sequel with visuals that really soar, I would gladly take it. I just wish it was with a better film, or at least with a film that I would want to rewatch over and again. Instead, this left an aftertaste that makes me want to instead go and watch Top Gun: Maverick for a fourth time. Outside of demo material, I don't even know if I will be a completionist and get this on UHD a few months down the line. Normally one shouldn't fault a film for letting their own speculation become expectation, but in this particular instance I very much believe that you can. All signs and promotions hinted toward a different kind of movie and story, but despite the good parts it did have, this was too much of a misguided, ineffectual whimper.\"}\n",

Only in this case, they decided to dump the \"stuff\" on the screen in this film. Jurassic World: Dominion has a lot of story arcs with no real connection or depth. People are popping in, popping back out, then popping in again, boring us with trite laughable dialogue and no real character development; you don\\'t really care about any of these people. Just when you think there might be something to a scene with the familar charcaters, CUT TO another scene with no set-up.

Unfortunately, every entry after is never as good or even downright bad. Jurassic World Dominion is the final entry in the Jurassic World trilogy and the one that unites the cast of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World together. To see the return of the main trio from Jurassic Park was the biggest reason I was looking forward to this film. Does Jurassic World Dominion stick the landing or is it just a big pile of s#*%?\\n\\nOne thing that the Jurassic World franchise has done better and better is the visuals. Jurassic World Dominion has no doubt the best visuals and cinematography of all the films so far. There are some pretty great shots of dinosaurs without a doubt. There are also some pretty fun action sequences. For example, in Malta where dinosaurs are chasing Chris Pratt and Bryce throughout the city. The part in Malta also explores the black market of Dinosaurs and that was pretty interesting. One pretty annoying issue with the Jurassic World franchise is the lack of animatronics but Dominion uses a lot of animatronics. I appreciated it as it made the Dinosaurs feel a bit more real when they were being interacted with.\\n\\nMy biggest reason for watching was the OG cast and it was great seeing all of them together again. Laura Dern and Sam Neill are great together as Ellie Satler and Alan Grant respectively. Both of them don\\'t phone it in and it feels like the same characters we last saw 21 years ago. My favourite is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm and he just steals every scene he is in. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard also return and they are fine. The movie introduces some new characters and one of them is Kayla played by DeWanda Wise. DeWanda is great and a real standout in the film thanks to her charismatic performance. Kayla ends up being a fun character to watch thanks to her coolness and natural reaction to all the craziness happening.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the rest of the movie is very difficult to like. My biggest annoyance is the plot. There are two plot lines, one with Chris Pratt involving a kidnapping of Maisie (the clone daughter from the previous film) and another with the OG cast which just features them snooping around a big corporation. One of the plotlines is more exciting and interesting while also resulting in thrilling dinosaur action. The OG cast plotline is just so boring, goofy and just dumb. It\\'s a shame that the OG cast was done dirty like that. The movie feels like two different movies shoved into one leading to two different stories with different tones. The main story also features this plot device concerning locusts and it\\'s just really stupid.\\n\\nThe movie also features a sort of new human villain in Dodgson played by Campbell Scott. I say sort of new because he is technically playing the same character that was briefly in the first Jurassic Park film albeit it\\'s a different actor now. He is just a very underwhelming villain. He is just not that interesting or threatening. They also have a new dinosaur villain in the Giganotosaurus and it also sucks. It barely has any screen time and is not even as scary as any of the previous dinosaur villains. There is also another new character introduced called Ramsay played by Mamoudou Athie who I think does a good job in the role. What makes his character is his supposed relationship with Dodgson which is mentioned a couple of times. However, it is barely explored yet for some reason is put into the film like it is an emotional or important element and it was just baffling.\\n\\nMaisie returns from the previous film and has become incredibly unlikeable. I\\'m not a big fan of bratty kid characters, especially ones that cause the deaths of dozens of innocent people. Her character is written poorly and I do think the actress gives a pretty weak performance which doesn\\'t help. The movie is also way too long with its runtime being 146 minutes. A majority of the runtime is just boring human stuff with maybe 15-20 minutes of some dinosaur stuff. The original Jurassic Park cast and the new Jurassic World cast don\\'t even meet until the final act. Once they meet, it feels very anti-climatic and unnatural, it just sort of happens. I\\'m gutted that the movie wastes an interesting idea in exploring the consequences of dinosaurs being released into the world and how the world deals with it. Instead, this idea is just brushed over within the first 5 minutes. The film doesn\\'t do anything original and just does dinosaurs on an island again! The movie doesn\\'t even spend time dealing with the message that the film starts with which is can humans and dinosaurs coexist? The film just ends with this magically being answered and resolved with no explanation how?\\n\\nOverall, what a massive disappointment. While I didn\\'t particularly enjoy Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), the movie ends on a fascinating note that could\\'ve made for an amazing 3rd film. Regrettably, Jurassic World Dominion ends up being more interested in being a cheap, cheesy, B movie action thrill and even then it doesn\\'t do that great either. I\\'m devastated that the so-called Avengers of the Jurassic franchise is just a very mediocre and underwhelming dinosaur movie. I ended up feeling like it was time for this franchise to go extinct. As Ian once said, \"that\\'s one big pile of s#*%\".'}\n",

Absolutely horrible on ever level and a fundamental misunderstanding at what makes this saga so interesting. Trevorrow had no clue what he was doing with this movie. He was told to make the final film in a six movie saga and said to himself \"Hmm let\\'s not focus on the dinosaurs in this FINAL FILM\". How do you not understand what people want to see these movies for. You need to actually focus on the dinosaurs or you are not gonna keep peoples attention and I feel that is what happened here. Instead the film focuses on giant locusts? Why is this so interesting that you need to sideline the dinosaurs for it. I didn\\'t want to see an espionage story about kidnapping, locusts, and clones. I just want to see what the world would be like if dinosaurs took over which we don\\'t see either. The main issue that happened in the previous film that CHANGED THE STATUS QUO is barely focused on besides a few scenes. It\\'s baffling why they would do this. Not even the original cast can save this. Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill seem like they are having fun but the dialogue they are given is horrendous. The dialogue in general is bad but they got it the worst. The whole cast generally doesn\\'t seem to be trying besides Neill and Goldblum. Everyone felt very low energy and if they didn\\'t want to be there. The villain gave the worst performance in the film. They just let that guy spitball all these awkward lines and just didn\\'t know when to say cut. The film feels relatively low stakes as well. It doesn\\'t feel like a finale at all but more like a bad epilogue. Fallen Kingdom feels more like a finale than this and that movie is BAD. There isn\\'t any build up to the final dinosaur battle as well. Apparently it was set up in the prologue that they released a year ago but they decided to cut it from the movie. They decide to cut the scene that shows the conflict between different species of dinosaur. Yeah great job guys. It doesn\\'t help that this film is mindlessly boring as well and it doesn\\'t deserve its 2 and a half hour runtime. This is a train wreck of a film that you shouldn\\'t watch even if you like the original film. It\\'s a waste of your money.'}\n",

Jurassic World: Dominion is a soulless film, without a shred of understanding of the magic of the original. This made-for-its-own-good movie has no originality on its own terms, no respect for the fans of this once-grand dinosaur movie series, and not an ounce of artistic merit to the film genre. On top of that, this film is also dumb from start to finish and full of holes in the story. It\\'s a good thing Trevorrow is also responsible for the screenplay and apparently spent years looking forward to this finale, because according to his own statements, he knew from the start to which end he wanted to lead the Jurassic World trilogy.\\n\\nThe film begins by leaving out its own story plots from the last two films. For example, how the dinosaurs were able to spread across the planet is left out, or it is assumed that you accept that this is explained via the illegal and legalized trade in the animals. The dinosaur scenes at the beginning are quite nice, but ultimately just a two-minute montage of big dinosaur scenes. The animal rescue comes across as a naive idea in the context of the film and additionally as a silly attempt at a cross-reference to the actually problematic treatment of animals in our society. The character development of Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is just thrown at you, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is so on the mark in his already shallow and cliché-laden development that as a viewer you can definitely handle the fact that he is now foolishly riding horses, severing individual dinosaurs from their herd for \"rescue\". Secondary characters are introduced, only to be used as vehicles for the unfolding silly story without any depth of their own. The story surrounding the characters in the Jurassic World series quickly devolves into a globe-trotting, bad James Bond knock-off with a focus on the use of firearms, car chases and silly, superficial short cons. It goes to some Arabian countries, to a stupidly hidden black market for dinosaur goods, to a reservation of the company of \"Dogson!\". We\\'ve got Dodgson here\" - Dodgson (Campbell Scott), who for reasons not told somehow managed to become one of the biggest tech moguls in the world. Just as somehow, by the way, he has also managed to recover the nostalgic cream can of Dennis Nedry\\'s dinosaur DNA theft and keep it on his shelf. Their story then just jumps from action scene to action scene, where the \"heroes\" of the story, staged in a very modern way, survive every adversity. Apart from gunshots and dinosaur attacks, they survive a plane crash, numerous accidents and explosions unharmed. This plot, which undercuts any suspense, also leads to no fear or adrenaline buildup at all around the characters, which should actually serve to help viewers identify with them. Trevorrow makes himself the king of despondency here and destroys the legacy of the original film and its two original and respectful sequels.\\n\\nBy the way, the motivation for the cloned girl Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) is simply thrown overboard. Yes, that\\'s how this trilogy was planned by the would-be visionary Trevorrow. Instead of the comprehensible cloning of the lost daughter, it is now the daughter herself who clones herself. The motivation, of course, is to save the world from disease and natural disasters. Oh, no, the motivation was the desire to save one\\'s own new self from a deadly disease from which one suffers. Or was it? Didn\\'t Trevorrow write a scene in which it\\'s made clear that Lockwood didn\\'t know about her disease when she cloned herself? Well, at least Trevorrow is so self-convinced that he doesn\\'t care about consistency in the plot even in the context of just one film. The director and filmmaker never seems to have read an ethics book either, because the cloning action is consensually presented as a moral heroic act. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) would have to perceive this as a slap in the face, but what do the philosophical underpinnings of the original matter if a film is just poured on with cool sayings and action scenes without paying attention to the plot or the development of individual highlights in the film.\\n\\nThe plot around the characters of the original resembles chicanery for the fans of the franchise. The dream team of Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), which worked so well, is suddenly a group consisting only of references to the grandiose start of the series, which becomes more insufferable, shallow and uninteresting by the minute. Their plot around the locust plague, which at least at the beginning seems like an interesting idea before it too is told into the barrel, is at least a tad better than the action movie scenes around Pratt and Howard. But again, it\\'s overflowing with plot holes, dumb lines, and a dynamic between Grant and Sattler so unpleasant it could make you sick. Laura Dern, by the way, plays her role so badly that she makes Ellie Sattler the most unpleasant character in the film, but since her Star Wars appearance, she\\'s been practiced at helping destroy classic franchises.\\n\\nBD Wong\\'s character development, by the way, is among the dumbest in film history. From an over-motivated and morally disinterested character in Jurassic Park, to the self-convinced and morally still subterranean leader in Jurassic World, to the morally now completely disintegrated dinosaur trader from Fallen Kingdom, we now witness here a Henry Wu who at the beginning of the film is still responsible for a biblical-capitalist plague of locusts, but at the end of the film is sneaking through a cornfield like a reformed science hippie, enjoying the redemptive feeling of moral poise. Incredibly stupid.\\n\\nUnbelievably stupid is much else in this film as well. The overpopulation of different dinosaurs that you get to see for a few seconds attests to a lack of understanding of the magic of the original and a lack of appreciation for the genius of how the dino scenes were handled there. The sprinkling of modern wokeness is still within limits, but where it does appear it is, as you might expect, just plain silly. The waste of potential from the old films is obvious here. The Dilophosaurs are wasted, the Carnosaurs are so scary that a couple of betting-addicted dino-fight viewers just keep watching a dino-human fight while a few feet behind them the Carnosaurs wreak havoc. The Dimetrodon, which by the way are not dinosaurs, are barely shown, just as no dinosaur can be viewed even once with enough time and calm, instead they become animal horror creatures with nothing on them but brutal aggressiveness. In the end, there is yet another stupid dinosaur fight that seems like an even dumber copy of the stupid finale of the otherwise watchable first part of the Jurassic World trilogy. The T-Rex pretending to be dead is perhaps the dumbest dino scene in the entire franchise. Let\\'s not forget that Dearing and Grady\\'s love for their adopted daughter is so strong that they simply make the girl stand very, very close to a velociraptor at the end of the film, because Grady is, after all, friends with this primeval predator. In order to shoot such nonsense, one must have a completely narcissistic alienation from reality.... One could go on for a long time listing the numerous plotholes, stupidities and the impudent lack of understanding of what made the original so fantastic, but that would probably take readers of this review just as long as this bloated action nonsense has running time. But one thing needs to be mentioned: The recap of the plot and the outcome for the planet presented at the end of the film is over-politicized, naive, unscientific garbage that you can either laugh your head off at in cynical fashion or cry yourself to sleep in lonely despair over humanity. Dinosaurs coexisting in harmony with the rest of nature, triceratops performing their savannah march with elephants, geese flying fearlessly with pterodactyls, blue whales swimming in peace alongside a mosasaur, and herds of wild horses, mingling with other racing dinosaur herds are certainly realistic and the ultimate goal that a human race should have in the context of a specially created species extinction by genetically manipulating the evolutionary rhythm of Earth\\'s history.\\n\\nAs a conclusion, it remains to mention once again that Trevorrow could impressively prove his complete lack of cinematic understanding with this film and that Star Wars: The Last Jedi now has to share the Olympus of destroyed franchises with Jurassic World: Dominion. Nothing short of a disgrace to cinema history. Tragic.'}\n",

It has been years since seeing the two 'Jurassic Park' sequels, but do remember not caring for them all that much at all (especially the third film). The first 'Jurassic World' was a lot of fun, though with flaws, and actually liked 'Fallen Kingdom' more than most while acknowledging that it had a lot of issues and that it wasn't great.\\n\\n'Jurassic World: Dominion' did sound interesting and was over the moon to see the original cast reuniting. Despite all of that, 'Jurassic World: Dominion' turned out to be a big disappointment and was something of an uncomfortable experience seeing it in the cinema. To me, it wasn't terrible and not as bad as has been said by some with some good things. But there are also a lot of faults that cannot be overlooked, even when taking the film for what it is and what it was aiming for.\\n\\nBeginning with the good, the scenery is absolutely beautiful and shot with a lot of slick style and atmosphere. There are some good action sequences here and some inventive stunt work, the whole Malta sequence is exhilarating and when the film finally shows some degree of energy. Also standing out in a good way is Claire's very tense horror film-like encounter with the dinosaur. The dinosaurs look absolutely great and show a lot of personality, the predatory ones being very creepy.\\n\\nSome of the performances are good, a wonderfully sarcastic Jeff Goldblum and DeWanda Wise stealing all their scenes. Also really enjoyed the chemistry between quietly charismatic Sam Neill and perky Laura Dern, that evoked a lot of nostalgia. The music score is suitably rousing.\\n\\nHowever, a lot is wrong here. The script is far too exposition heavy and tends to over-explain, shining only with Goldblum's sarcastic quips. Plus everything with ByoSen is incredibly heavy handed and says nothing illuminating or insightful about corruption. The film is much too long, half an hour could easily have been trimmed which would have been achieved if the story got going sooner and if the climax was shorter. It also drags quite badly, especially the very slight and dully paced first act and the climax does lack tension and felt dragged out, was actually feeling the minutes rather than being enthralled. The whole ByoSen subplot feels like a different film and a marginally more interesting but still heavy handed and convoluted one at that, a lot of the second half does not make sense and left more questions than answers. Wu's part could have been left out completely.\\n\\nDid feel overall that 'Jurassic World: Dominion' could have done with a lot more tension and suspense and quite frankly the later action sequences did leave me feel exhausted and felt too much visually and audibly. There is no heart, charm or soul here, neither are there any brains, which play completely second fiddle to the big and loud approach taken through. The other performances do not convince, Bryce Dallas Howard does her best but has too little to do while Chris Pratt's frequently out stretched do all the emoting. Isabella Ferman came over as annoying and BD Wong is too much in Dr George Huang mode which doesn't gel with the rest of the film. Worst of all is an incredibly bland and a long way from menacing Campbell Scott as the very underwritten and afterthought-like villain.\\n\\nIn conclusion, could have been so much better. 5/10.\"}\n",

The old returning actors are not enough to save the clunky dialogue or the absolutely pointless story here. As a conclusion to this trilogy, it fails in a majority of areas. Worst of all, in addition to being sloppily put together, is it's beyond derivitive. I honestly feel like I've seen the majority of these story tropes used in a vast catalog of other, much better films. Also, it has one of the worst villians I've seen put to screen. His acting and the dialogue for his character was about the equivilant of a 3 year old throwing a tantrum. Beyond annoying and even more unrealistic. The special FX weren't even anything awesome, just more of the same. However, I do have to give it up to the team that did the creature designs for the practical FX, those were more impressive. I would recommend waiting for streaming, it wasn't even worth seeing on the IMAX as the majority of scenes were not worthy of the scale. 1/2 a dino out of 5.\\n110 out of 165 found this helpful.

Now, I hope it loses itself.\\n\\nJurassic World Dominion has its positives, namely the fantastic Legacy character\\'s wonderful return and, well, that\\'s it. I enjoyed their presence, especially Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum - the latter who had the best lines, as always. The rest...yeah, I sincerely hope this is the last Jurassic Anything.\\n\\nAll throughout this movie, the word \"Dumb\" just kept popping up in my head. Dumb script. Dumb dialogue. Dumb luck with all the hilariously impossible coincidences. Too many Dumb references to this series and other Steven Spielberg classics. And the two Dumbest characters in the franchise are back: Clone Girl Maisie who hates all mankind for her decision in the last entry and that screaming boy, Franklin, though, THANK GOD, he doesn\\'t scream in this one like all the scenes he ruined in the last one.\\n\\nWith a huge missed opportunity to expand on the actual title of Jurassic World, this hopefully last chapter just has society dealing with dinos killing people and the economy while debating if they should be extinguished.

      "{'ratings': '7/10', 'title': 'Flawed but lots of FUN', 'movie_id': '8041270', 'author': 'parksiet11', 'date': 'June 2022', 'content': '\"Jurassic World Dominion\" is a movie I genuinely don\\'t know how to feel about. Parts of me really liked it, and other parts were very critical and disappointed in it. It\\'s one I might have to see again to really firm up my opinion. Regardless... I had fun with this movie. I just want to make it clear it is nowhere near as bad as some people say it is; it\\'s not perfect, but it is still lots of fun! However this is definitely the weakest in the \"Jurassic World\" trilogy, but I am someone who loved \"Jurassic World\" and for the most part really liked \"Fallen Kingdom\". I have to say, I did like this more than the original sequels to \"Jurassic Park\", and I thought this did serve as a nice finale to the series, even if it has changed substantially.\\n\\nI think my biggest issue here was how different it was from what I wanted and expected to see coming off the ending of \"Fallen Kingdom\", but I can\\'t blame the movie for that. I feel like there were many more interesting stories that could\\'ve been told here, but what we got was okay. It just makes me want to see more from this world at this time, with the dinosaurs being out in the world it leaves a lot of potential stories open to be told! This story, however, was very poorly told. It was exceptionally weakly written, and was not compelling or interesting for much of the film. I normally get into films pretty easily, but it took me a good 45 minutes to get into this one. The script even felt like fan-fiction at times, and never really sold me on what was going on. The script has no emotion to it, the audience has no emotional connection to the characters (even the old ones) and I felt like I didn\\'t really care what happened in multiple instances. The cloning problem... the locusts... Biosyn... it\\'s just all sort of there... and the film is very much an overstuffed jumble of characters and plotlines.\\n\\nThe most heinous crime however: the fact that this film normalizes dinosaurs being in the world. Because of this, we lose the awe and wonder of seeing dinosaurs alongside the characters, a feeling that has been present in every \"Jurassic\" film until now. Not only that, but we also lose the scare factor that makes these films so great. There\\'s no suspense, no tension, just straight action. Every dinosaur scene doesn\\'t feel as threatening as it should... and there\\'s a moment in the finale that is a prime example of this. I also did not love the locusts plot... took way too much away from the dinosaurs. Like... this is a dinosaur movie right? In the (paraphrased) words of Ian Malcolm: Do you plan to have dinosaurs in your dinosaur movie? The script does not balance itself well either, the characters have no compelling drama or story and the dinosaurs don\\'t either... it just feels hollow. Where are all the big ideas about genetic experimentation and natural consequences? I also found the film to be both too long and not long enough. There are way too many characters, and half are unnecessary, they just take up screen time. And one other thing... WHY WASN\\'T THE PROLOGUE IN THE FILM?! They released this great 5 minute sequence as advertising last year, saying it was the prologue to the film, and yet the movie instead starts with an abysmally executed \"last time on Jurassic World...\" kind of recap. Having the prologue in solves a whole ton of the issues I have with the film; it mirrors the end in interesting ways and sets up some conflicts, as well as shows an interesting scene that is mentioned multiple times throughout the film. Plus it\\'s a much more entertaining way to begin the film.\\n\\nOkay... one more bad to go. Colin Trevorrow\\'s direction. He genuinely did a terrible job here. It was so bland and had no style, it lost all Spielbergian charm he may have had when doing the first \"Jurassic World\". JA Bayona at least brought excellent gothic horror stylings to \"Fallen Kingdom\" which really made it feel horrific... and then we go to this bland, generic stuff. Nothing sticks out, it\\'s just generic blockbuster filmmaking. Sure there are a few interesting visuals and a final montage that I love, but I\\'m sure under a different direction they would be even better.\\n\\nNow, you might be wondering: after all those criticisms, how did you still enjoy it? Well, despite it not being what I wanted and being a very flawed film, it was at least fun! I was entertained, there was some cool Dino stuff, some fun action set-pieces, and I loved that the production team committed to using more animatronics for the dinosaurs. It just helped make them feel more authentic! I also LOVED the return of the original cast, and was so happy to see they actually played major roles in the plot. Plus, the new cast from the current films wasn\\'t half-bad either. I also loved how the human villain is technically from the first film, and there were some many great nods to the original \"Jurassic Park\"! Speaking of the villain... Biosyn is literally an evil Apple, and Dodgson is literally an evil Tim Cook... right down to the look! I loved this sly critique of modern capitalist culture, and how many companies (especially in the tech sector) behave. There were also some really cool visual sequences, and the sound in this movie was great! I also loved Michael Giacchino\\'s score! He did a lot of the heavy lifting for the emotion of the film, trying his best to make it resonate with music where the screenplay couldn\\'t. And by god it worked! This score really did elevate so many moments for me, and used themes from all over!\\n\\nSo while I do think this film is deeply flawed, I enjoyed it! I\\'m still not 100% sure how I feel about it, but I do know I liked it better than \"Jurassic Park 3\"! I would definitely recommend seeing it, especially if you have enjoyed the rest of this franchise. I wouldn\\'t even mind seeing more! There\\'s still a ton of potential for future stories, and I think I would enjoy this even more knowing this is just the beginning of something new. While it is no \"Jurassic Park\", and definitely doesn\\'t have suspense... it is a really fun action blockbuster! If you can get through the 1st act... the last 2/3 are a great time! I loved parts, but some didn\\'t work for me, and yet I would still recommend checking it out! How could you say no to dinosaurs?'}\n",

I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It\\'s kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I\\'m left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.\\n\\nMy other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I\\'ve shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn\\'t a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.\\n\\nAs I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn\\'t the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn\\'t seem to think anything through, past Peter\\'s initial request.\\n\\nNo Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post \"Into the Spider-verse\" world. It\\'s catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it\\'s more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I\\'ve typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.\\n\\nThis return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was \"really, we\\'re going there?\" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I\\'m at a point right now where I\\'m questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn\\'t what I\\'d call a complete failure, but I\\'m concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies.'}\n",

No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D.

This movie is for low-attention-span adrenaline-immuned viewers, which unfortunately there are more and more of. Unless you are a group of teenagers looking for a night-out, I would not recommend this movie at all.\\n\\nI didn't expect much from this movie other to be an entertaining comic-book-like story. Boy, was I disappointed. It has been no more than a collection of random fight scenes with incoherent story and almost random dialogues in-between. Also, I think the casting of Spider-man, M. J. and Aunt May are just horrible. Tom Holland appears to have the brain of a 10-year old, and Zendaya is great in other films, but as MJ she just doesn't work, same goes for Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) she looks way too young, flirty and brainless, exact opposite of what this character should be.\\n\\nOverall it is a slaughterhouse to everything that spider-man should stand for. It is concentrated around universes and egocentric personal problems instead of being a moral model of real-world problems. The 2.5 hours long movie seem to just be an adrenaline shot one after the other, no substance and nothing to learn from. I'm sadden by having to write this, the production quality is great but where is a plot, a moral and generally being a better person.

      "{'ratings': '1/10', 'title': 'In no way good', 'movie_id': '10872600', 'author': 'Criticalstaff14', 'date': 'March 2022', 'content': 'It might be the worst movie ever made. Not just because it is bad, but because of the misuse of all the resources that went into making it.\\n\\nI will be the first to admit that I have propensity to look for meaning when I am watching a film. Be it the straight-forward moral of the story or a higher meaning, something to make you think. That is how I enjoy cinema the most, when it gives me something to think about. Big or small. When the images on the screen are about something more than simply the images on the screen.\\n\\nThis film is the complete opposite of it. Its meaning is inward-looking. It is not interested of looking at anything other than itself. It is complete and utter navel-gazing. That really is the crux of the film. That is the reason why this is barely watchable. Every flaw and mistake comes from this movie\\'s own excessive self-contemplation.\\n\\nWhere to put the blame is a different question. It has been established for some time that these MCU films are not \"directed\". There is no singular vision behind them and it boils down to an assembly line. The plot and dialogue are so bad I can\\'t imagine anyone put any amount of thought into it. All the lines do actually feel like ad-libs the actors improvised on the day. Visually there is an absence of flair (and I am being generous) which is on par for the course for these movies by now. The soundtrack and sound design is, of course, forgettable. The editing is conventional. The set design is reminiscent of those real-estate videos where celebrities show their homes. The costume design is ok, again which is not shocking knowing the means that were allocated to this.\\n\\nThe acting could have been the saving grace of the movie. Unfortunately, Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are the stars of the film. And while their performances are good, they usually have to share the screen with (multiple) Oscar-winners. It is jarring to see the best talent doing what is basically glorified background work. That is why this is the worst movie of all time. You have a film packed with the best actors working today, but we have to follow Tom Holland\\'s inane struggle on how to apply to some college.\\n\\nI am not even sure I want to go into the plot. In truth it does not matter. I suspect that even the makers of this took that as a given. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now morphed into a never ending reference and call-backs machine. That is the core of this film: \"remember this?!\" The structure of it is one of a TV show, except in TV there is an A-plot and a B-plot. This film is all B-plot.\\n\\nAs I am writing this, this film has been viewed by millions and is one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Please kill me now.'}\n",

While this new show isn't exactly 100% in line with the animated show, it is close enough that you don't really notice it. The SFX aren't too over done to the point of being ridiculous, and the writing was done so that it was able to condense a 20 episode animated season, into 8 episodes and not really miss anything (unlike how the movie did..).

We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.\\n\\nThis adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.\\n\\nThe stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.\\n\\nI do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.\\n\\nBut in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)\\n\\nAnd despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :) Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.\\n\\nI think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.\\n\\n(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)\"}\n",

I decided to check on one of the writers and listened to her story about how she got into the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a fan fiction and rom-com enthusiast, and was solely focused on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the brainstorm room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics affected the show.\\n\\nThe live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out by lazily cramming in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang, chopping and mixing up the reunion with Bumi and the Gaang, expunging developed habits like Katara's nagging and Sokka's negative thinking, rewriting Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim, politicizing an ancient Earth Kingdom legend, revealing Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself too early, cutting out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding, deleting subtleties like Katara's necklace that affect Pakku's arc, swapping Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance, disclosing the comet that was part of an investigation, etc.\\n\\nThere is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. From playing with his airball buddies to losing them due to his avatar status to shirking his duties says a lot more than delivering a speech. This happens in each episode if not in every scene, but it does seem to happen in modern television, so the fault lies in the writers and maybe the editors. By choosing the least creative path, you are robbing the viewer the chance to fantasize and to be fascinated. There is no shame in following the superior version down to its dialogue and screenplays.\\n\\nAaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. It should be clear by now that you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.\"}\n",

The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.\\n258 out of 416 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.\\nPermalink\"}\n",

It's good, nothing more or less in my opinion.\\n\\n'Avengers: Age of Ultron' isn't too far off 2012's 'The Avengers', especially in terms of how I fell about it. I definitely wanted more from both, yet they are still satisfying superhero action flicks. I'd rank this narrowly below the aforementioned.\\n\\nRobert Downey Jr. felt a little flat to me as Iron Man - he still has a decent amount of moments, just not as many as you get in his individual films. All the others continue to entertain to an equally suitable level, I didn't overly like the characters of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen but I also don't have any noteworthy negatives about them. The story between Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo didn't do much for me either.\\n\\nWith that noted, it is still an enjoyable ride through the 141 minute run time. The ending is intriguing, interested to see where that goes - I have a minor inkling about the mid-credits scene, given all the internet attention that has had - even for someone like me who knows very little overall.\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '7/10', 'title': 'Messier, for sure, but still plenty of \"Avengers\" fun', 'movie_id': '2395427', 'author': 'Movie_Muse_Reviews8', 'date': 'May 2016', 'content': 'The task of bringing together Earth\\'s mightiest heroes took Joss Whedon into uncharted territory with 2012\\'s \"The Avengers,\" and, despite the weight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on his shoulders, the results were staggeringly entertaining. The task of making a sequel to that ground-breaking, monumental event film, however, and being expected to deliver on par or better results, is an entirely different beast.\\n\\n\"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" was definitely built on the bullet point takeaways of \"The Avengers,\" which are: Make time and space for wit, banter and humor for the sake of humor to prevent the film from taking itself too seriously; give each character a story arch and independent moments; choreography clever action sequences with well-timed glory shots. These components are in full force in \"Ultron\" and make enjoying the blockbuster as easy as shoving a lollipop in your mouth.\\n\\nYet \"Ultron\" is infinitely more complex than its predecessor. The number of heroes featured barely fits into a single action figure play case, meaning more subplots and back story, in addition to creating an arch of the creation and life of Ultron itself. With a plot that takes the Avengers from the eastern European country of \"Sokovia\" to New York to the African nation of \"Wakanda\" to Seoul, South Korea to Sokovia again, much of \"Age of Ultron\" is a non-stop blur.\\n\\nThe film opens with the Avengers leading an assault on a secret HYDRA facility where they have located the staff that Loki used to lead the Chitauri invasion in \"The Avengers.\" When they secure it and bring it back to New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover that its power source contains a blueprint for artificial intelligence, which would allow Stark to proceed with his Ultron project, an initiative to create peace-keeping robots that could defend the world in place of the Avengers should another alien invasion occur. When Ultron (voiced by James Spader) becomes conscious, however, he interprets his peace-keeping instructions as an imperative to wipe out humankind.\\n\\nAdded to the mix are the Maximoff twins, Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) – also known as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch – who decide to serve Ultron, with the latter using her powers to give each of the Avengers dangerous visions that could tear them apart.\\n\\nThe fight scenes and action sequences are in such abundance in \"Ultron\" that it\\'s impossible to remember them all, and the ones that are most distinct, such as Iron Man chasing down and taming a rampant Hulk using his Hulkbuster armor, are ancillary to the narrative of finding what Ultron is up to and stopping it. In other words – it\\'s all for show. The creativity of the fight choreography also gets lost in the whirlwind of action. Captain America (Chris Evans) probably does 12 different awesome things with his shield, but they happen so fast you\\'ll be hard pressed to recall any one of them in detail. Really clever sequences are only as fun as the build-up and payoff and those pieces are given no time to breathe.\\n\\nWhedon does allow for pauses in the chaos, such as the swanky Avengers Tower party featuring the film\\'s best scene, when each Avenger tries his hand at lifting Thor\\'s hammer, or a quiet retreat to an unexpected safe house in the countryside, but it\\'s simply a trade- off: instead of busy action sequences, we get character relationship dynamics and back story.\\n\\n\"Ultron\" is inundating, to be frank, but for the everything-but-the-sink mentality, it\\'s carried by its sense of humor and a cast whose members have each proved themselves time and again to be magnetic both on their own and as part of this team. Some of the novelty has worn off, but seeing all these characters together remains a treat that even the most convoluted of stories cannot entirely dismantle. Marvel Studios truly proves with \"Ultron\" the credibility that it has built with fans, to the point that even when it gets a little ambitious and mettles a bit more (you can easily see Whedon at odds with them in this final cut), its reputation remains intact and the fans placated.\\n\\nAs \"Phase III\" begins, adding even more characters to Marvel\\'s cinematic universe (and even sliding Spider-Man into the mix) en route to the two-part \"Avengers: Infinity War\" slated for 2018 and 2019, it will be interesting to see if Marvel Studios barrels along into more unwieldy but delicious chaos, or reins it in a touch. Either way, should be fun.\\n\\n~Steven C\\n\\nThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more'}\n",

While the story isn't as good as the first Avengers, the acting is still just as good, the action is even better, and Ultron isn't a bad villain, he's just an under-developed one. Honestly, the action makes up for most of the flaws of this movie and it also set up a lot of MCU films, or at least foreshadowed a lot. Movies like Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, and Captain America: Civil War.

In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he\\'s just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks \"illusion- woman\" and \"not-the-flash\"....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON.\\n\\nInstead of the robot dominated dystopian future that we saw in the comics, what we do get is more \"the next few days of Ultron\". No matter, it is an exciting few days with director Joss Whedon balancing the intercharacter dynamics with awesome action pieces from claustrophobic close combat, to a freeway chase, to the much advertised no holds barred beat down between the Hulk and iron man\\'s new \"hulk buster\" Armour. All this is supplemented with beautiful special effects from Industrial Lights and Magic ILM. Flawless work befitting the movie\\'s massive Budget.\\n\\nIn The villain, Ultron, the Writers have crafted a memorable though under utilised bad guy. Ultron could have been the vehicle to explore deeper themes, themes that were merely hinted at but never fleshed out. Instead, His cynical yet refined snarling courtesy of James Spader reminds me of the those magnificently passionate Super villains that were so common in Saturday morning cartoons of old.\\n\\nAnd that is exactly what this is. AGE OF ULTRON can be described as a true live action cartoon. The dialogue is light hearted, the story is straightforward, the tone is fun and the action is immense. And this is not exactly a good thing. Intense scenes are interrupted and spoilt with poorly placed humour and once again the story does not seem to take itself seriously.\\n\\nFights are over-choreographed, more like some fancy ballet than an all out battle. The fact that it cuts to graceful slow motion once in a while only emphasises the dance like nature of the fights.\\n\\nAnd yet the movie felt like pieces of it were cut out. The narrative does not flow as smoothly as the first with inexplicable scenes like Thor suddenly going off on his hallucination trip. Much of the premise and the characters development up to this point very much depends on the viewer watching prior marvel movies.\\n\\nIt is here that Marvel studio\\'s continuity heavy Creative direction rears its ugly head. To know what is going on in this movie, one would have to watch the previous movies. Captain America the winter soldier, iron man 3, the first avengers movie. But perhaps that\\'s the point? Force people to go buy the Blu rays or the video to rewatch and get up to speed. In the end, the real big winner is distributor Disney. Ka-Ching $$.\\n\\nI like a good comedy. In in a big action blockbuster, I like to believe that the stakes are real, that the dangers faced by our heroes are real, that they are really fighting for the fate of the world. Instead, we get this cartoony violence, with equally cartoony superficial story, where heroes joke around with quick lighthearted quips in the middle of a fight scene where people could die. This kills tension. And if it weren\\'t for the magnificent effects, action and direction, AGE OF ULTRON would have scored a bit lower.'}\n",

Yes it is miles way better than Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Terminator Genisys I have enjoyed this film much better than Jurassic World, Star Wars and Terminator the new movies.\\n\\nThis film is fun, popcorn, Action and entertaining action sequel flick. I like the first one but I love this one much more. The first time I watch it, I did not like this film at all, it did not work for me, but the second time around this flick was awesome and it become one of my favorite MARVEL superhero movies. I love this film so much, more than the first Avengers. James Spader made the movie for me! So much better than Loki.\\n\\nJames Spader and Robert Downey Jr. played together in a teen movie Tuff Turf in 1985 and 30 years later they teamed together to star in a MARVEL comic book super hero film. I like Tuff Turf but Avengers: Age of Ultron is far way better film to me. I love this film so much and I will never get the backlash. Joss Whedon gave me everything I wanted in a sequel. This and the first film are in my top 10 films of all time.\\n\\nI waited a long time for this universe and I am loving every minute of it. Superhero movies come out all time but something like this is what I love about movies.\\n\\nPlot: Tony Stark creates the Ultron Program to protect the world, but when the peace-keeping program becomes hostile, The Avengers go into action to try and defeat a virtually impossible enemy\\'s to get. Earth\\'s mightiest heroes must come together once again to protect the world from global extinction.\\n\\nI really enjoy this movie I don\\'t get the backslash and a lot of people were disappointed with this sequel that it is not so good as the first film. Age of Ultron is in my top 3 favorite comic book films. Number 1 will always be Captain America: The Winter Soldier and number 2 will be Captain America: The First Avenger, I just love those two films: Captain America is my favorite superhero character in MARVEL comic books.\\n\\nCaptain America in this movie is the most decent hero in this movie, he did not want the leave the island with people stuck on it, he refused too, I have seen a hero in him.\\n\\nPeople are keep getting upset over Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), \"oh look what they did with Black Widow.\" I saw the film and I am seeing her kicking ass or calm down the Hulk, which is a pretty ballsy thing to do. Specially for someone who has no balls and she is kicking ass and driving motorcycle, driving around shooting for Cap, helping them to get vision android to beat Ultron and she is the only one with no powers, except Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), she has the to get the thing for them. I think it would be weird to kidnapped Thor, if you put Thor in the scene duh. I enjoy this movie much more than the first film, the first film I liked okay, I like the first Avengers film. This is a fun popcorn entertainment flick that I really love.\\n\\nI like the romance between Black Widow with Hulk it was really good fast paced entertainment. I love Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch I like the twist by the end of the film that she turn her side around when she found out that Ultron wants to destroy everything on this planet I love that. You have Aaron Taylor-Johnson in it from Kick-Ass film as Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver sadly he dies on the end of the film, but he saves Hawkeye and a kid from Ultron firing bunch of bullets on them I thought that was pretty decent in the film. In my opinion Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a good job playing his character. I love that they return Samuel L. Jackson to the movie back as Nick Fury and that he help them out fighting Ultron. James Spader did a terrific excellent job playing Ultron.\\n\\nAvengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012\\'s The Avengers and the eleventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).\\n\\nYou have a lot of action in it, I also love that Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton work together after Ultron failed to destroy them and they go in to safe house to Clinton\\'s family, I like that. When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) touches Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor I like that you see a background of Natasha Romanoff\\'s childhood, I like that. I love the African shipyard you see them on a ship and I love the last stand. I love that the Vision helps Avengers to destroy and stop Ultron from extinction. Btw I love to death Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) she is so beautiful and charming I love her. Overall: I am giving this flick 10 out of 10 for me Age of Ultron is my #3 favorite super hero movie. I can\\'t wait for the next movie: Captain America: Civil War.'}\n",

Besides making fun of War Machine - again - and completely ignoring characters like Pepper Potts and Falcon, there was nothing that bothered me tremendously about this film. Keep in mind that it is a comic book film with superheros that dress funny, though.\\n\\nThe villain is pretty menacing, the interaction between the Avengers goes well beyond killing enemies in each other\\'s blind spot and the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver addition was interesting, though kind of condescending. I mean, if they want to ban Tin-tin cartoons for racist depictions of African people, they should stop at one moment or another inventing countries with Slavic names and filling them with helpless women and children with names just as ridiculous and toy soldier police and army forces. I am just saying.\\n\\nWhat I thought was better than I was expecting from an Avengers movie were the underlying character stories. Thanks to Scarlet Witch we see bits of our heros\\' histories, we get to know Hawkeye a little better and understand his role in a team of superpowered individuals, he see the romantic side of Black Widow and the Hulk... yes, you read that right... and we get to see Captain America and Tony Stark having ideological arguments that divide the team. Of course, they carry them with vibranium shield throws and energy beams, like men do... don\\'t they?\\n\\nI loved the character of The Vision, a freak hybrid between a servile AI and a full psycho AI, holding the power of an Infinity Stone and having a 3D printed body that is half alive, half vibranium. I share his view of humanity as queer pets that you have to enjoy during their short life.\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t like is that they upped the ante of what the Avengers can do, just because they could. In the end this diminished the level of empathy that one can feel for superhumans like that and removed from the quality of storytelling. Also, another film in which artificial intelligence builds bodies and kills people. Why would it? Ultron\\'s motivation was completely unexplored and his philosophy and references to Pinocchio made no sense at all. OK, it was meant to be insane, but even insanity has purpose and sense. Overall, I think the biggest problem with the film was that it had too much of a budget.\\n\\nBottom line: brainless fun, but fun nonetheless. Less humor than expected, with Ultron teasing an interesting character with his jokes, but then devolving to a classic villain in the sea of special effects that filled most of the movie. You get to know the Avengers more, as well, which was nice.'}\n",

Put in.\\n\\nSo, you thinking why is this film so bad, if you are a fan, you should love it. Well the film changes pace, very quickly and abruptly, which is a poor sign of movie making. The Characters do not act like they would usually act in the same scenario, the progression of the story is all over the place, Scene's that just have no weight or meaning to the film, but in there because it looks cool or is setting up another independent super hero movie, the Villain that is so smart, but doesn't use the internet and his ability to control everything just to wipe out everybody, but rather has this ridiculously stupid plan. The Hero's that are suppose to be smart, intelligent and some what Spanish do not see all of the stupid plot hole that get infiltrated.\\n\\nThe fighting was also a problem for me, it was the same.

On paper it does have a relatively good cast and it'd be a pity to waste it on overblown action but it's not really an actors type of film and while the production team deserves some credit for trying to concentrate on character but it's not developed enough to be entirely successful and comes across as rather shallow\\n\\nDespite this short review I'm big enough to stick up my hand and say this movie isn't produced for grumpy , middle aged men like myself , it's produced for younger people who can't get enough superhero movies and for this market the prospective audience will probably love it so much so that that'll be a contender for biggest grossing film of 2015 and we'll be getting more Marvel movies for the foreseeable future\"}\n",
      "Another Monumental Marvel Movie!\n",
      "{'ratings': '10/10', 'title': 'Another Monumental Marvel Movie!', 'movie_id': '2395427', 'author': 'rannynm29', 'date': 'April 2015', 'content': 'The Avengers assemble once again go up against a new corrupt, A.I. Ultron (James Spader). As the troupe pursue their mission, we\\'re given a deeper understanding of our favorite super heroes.\\n\\nThere are not enough words in the world to express how happy I am. As a Marvel fan, this film showcases some of my favorite comic book characters together in one plot line in a bigger and better way. When you are dealing with a sequel, as a filmmaker, you\\'re pretty much trying to top yourself. Thankfully, the filmmakers have out done themselves here. We\\'re given a superior conflict, more characters and action beyond epic proportions.\\n\\nI love this movie not only because it\\'s a phenomenal Marvel film, but also an outstanding film in general. A movie is supposed to grab the audience and transport them to a universe with characters that not only we look up to but also identify with. Marvel has successfully created this reality. Every time I see a Marvel logo on a movie poster I\\'m excited to be sent back, once again, into their universe.\\n\\nMarvel is a genius entertainment company because they establish their characters in previous films. The Avengers are the protagonist. Every character is given their moment in the lime light but, they are not the main focus. They all share the screen and have their own personal conflict, yet they respond as team. That is not to say that there is no character development, there is. Former story lines help save time so that the writers can focus on perfecting the current story. This also leads to much stronger relationships between the characters.\\n\\nFor people who have no history with Marvel films, I suggest that you see some of the previous films that feature the Avengers. The reason is that you may miss a connection with the characters that can be resolved by watching previous films. Although you will enjoy the action and story even without seeing the previous films, the inside jokes and interactions between characters become funnier when you understand the past.\\n\\nThe action in this film is awesome! The word awesome is a very primitive word, but it explains everything. While I love to go to the movies and appreciate storytelling and 3 dimensional characters, there are times when I just want to see things go boom! Every Avenger, with his or her different abilities, works together and kicks butt. An example of this is when Thor hits Captain America\\'s shield and causes a devastating explosion. You have to see it to believe it.\\n\\nMy favorite character is, Vision (Paul Bettany) an android created by Ultron. Bettany is originally the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark\\'s (Robert Downey, Jr.) A.I. companion. Bettany uses his fantastic voice to create Vision. I was excited when I heard he was going to be a new addition to the Avengers team. Not only is the acting and personality spot on, but the costume design is beautiful.\\n\\nThere are so many scenes that I adore, but my favorite is when the Avengers, \"get acquainted\" with Vision for the first time. This is the second A.I. the group has encountered and they\\'re unsure if they can trust him. Vision is uncertain himself and gives a speech on why it doesn\\'t matter because they all want to stop Ultron. At the end of his speech there is a comedic pay-off that shows which side Vision is truly on.\\n\\nThe moral of the film is, \"The way to peace is not destruction.\" Ultron is built for one reason - to create peace in our time. Ultron is confused on how to fulfill that mission and believes the only way to achieve his goal is to wipe out the human race and start over. However, Ultron underestimates the soul of man.\\n\\nI give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11- to 18 year- olds. There is language and intense action that younger kids might not be able to handle. Check out this film in theaters May 1 and remember, a true Marvel fan stays to the end of the credits.\\n\\nReviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

      "{'ratings': '8/10', 'title': 'Strong sequel', 'movie_id': '2395427', 'author': 'ossie859', 'date': 'April 2023', 'content': \"Avengers: Age of Ultron is an underrated film that, while not quite living up to the original Avengers movie, still manages to deliver plenty of humor and superhero action. The movie brings back our favorite heroes, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk, as they face off against a new foe - the artificial intelligence program known as Ultron.\\n\\nOne of the strongest aspects of this film is its continued focus on the relationships between the Avengers. We see a deeper exploration of the romantic relationship between Black Widow and the Hulk and get to see more of Hawkeye's personal life. These character moments add emotional weight to the action sequences and give the audience more reasons to care about what's happening on the screen.\\n\\nThe humor in the movie is well-done, with plenty of witty one-liners and comedic setpieces. Joss Whedon, who wrote and directed the film, has a talent for balancing humor with more dramatic moments, which helps keep the tone of the movie consistent.\\n\\nHowever, the plot of the film is a bit convoluted, with lots of subplots and new characters introduced in a short amount of time. Additionally, Ultron, while an interesting and dynamic villain, doesn't quite measure up to Loki from the first Avengers movie in terms of character development and overall impact.\\n\\nDespite these criticisms, Avengers: Age of Ultron is still an entertaining and enjoyable superhero movie. It's a fun ride that delivers on action, humor, and heart, and continues to explore the relationships between our favorite heroes. While it may not quite reach the heights of the original Avengers, it's still a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"}\n",

Why I think this is the best superhero sequel ever.\\n\\nOkay first thing this film is action packed there is a lot more action than the first one so basically the story is still there but the action literally takes over.\\n\\nSecond thing is the Hulkbuster now you may be thinking is it as awesome as it looks on the trailer the answer is yes...it is a lot more awesome than on the trailer and plus that action sequence goes on for quite some time.\\n\\nThird thing Ultron now Ultron may have been toned down to how he was in the comics but in this film he is still as malevolent and vicious as ever but with limits obviously with it being PG-13. Ultron in this film is played by James Spader and he doesn't lack at all you can still tell that Ultron is one of the most dangerous villain The Avengers have ever faced.\\n\\nFourth thing the plot the film this time doesn't rely too much on it's story it's more the action that builds the film obviously there is still a story and it's a very good one there are some bits where the film slows down for it but that is really what a superhero film is about especially generation, when we rely on origin stories in superhero films.\\n\\nFifth and final thing does it feel like too much Disney? the answer for that question is no it doesn't see the first film really felt like it was too much Disney but in this film it's a lot darker than the first film because you see some of The Avengers literally feel pain. Plus the first film was more of a full on introduction to The Avengers and what they do. This film is far from Disney now and well in that case that's better I did love the first film too.\\n\\nIf you are a superhero fan and loved Ultron in the comics then you are going to love him even more in the film. This film was worth every penny and I think that well mainly superhero fans should go see this movie don't wait for it to come out on DVD just go see because it is amazing and is far better than the first. 8/10 must see superhero film.\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '6/10', 'title': 'Grossly underwhelming (spoiler free)', 'movie_id': '2395427', 'author': 'charzhino25', 'date': 'April 2015', 'content': \"Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.\\n\\nThat being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing.\\n\\nSo starting with the tone. I like to laugh as I'm sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. It's not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? It would kill any tension! 2) The script. I won't say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. Again, its not the fact that the film is 2.5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn't am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains.\\n\\nSo as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time.\"}\n",

      "Messy and Inconsistent Plot Points, Over bloated With Teen Melodrama, But Pretty Visuals\n",

For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.\\n\\n2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.\\n\\n3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.\\n\\n4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.\\n\\nCons: 1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.\\n\\n2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.\\n\\n3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.\\n\\n4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.\\n\\n5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.\\n\\n6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.\\n\\n7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.\\n\\n8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.\\n\\n9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.\\n\\n10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?\"}\n",

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.\\n\\nWhen the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.\\n\\nIve always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.\\n\\nWould definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it.

After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.\\n\\nAs someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.\\n\\nFirst of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.\\n\\nVisually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.\\n\\nStory-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).\\n\\nThere's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.\"}\n",

The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.\\n\\nSince the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nFor the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.\\n\\nIs it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.\"}\n",

      "{'ratings': '5/10', 'title': 'Disappointingly Repetitive - Avatar: The Way of Water', 'movie_id': '1630029', 'author': 'mmarab9110', 'date': 'June 2023', 'content': \"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.\\n\\nOne of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.\\n\\nFurthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.\\n\\nAnother major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.\\n\\nDespite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.\"}\n",

And I don\\'t even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don\\'t even notice. That\\'s how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we\\'ve made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron\\'s most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:\\n\\n~ The story is paper-thin.\\n\\n~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.\\n\\n~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.\\n\\n~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.\\n\\n~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.\\n\\n~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.\\n\\nAnd yet.....\\n\\nIT\\'S SO DAMN COOL.\\n\\nThe world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It\\'s stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it\\'s damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it\\'s real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It\\'s like meeting with friends you haven\\'t seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she\\'s just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People\\'s chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.\\n\\nBut the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri\\'s children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The \"but one\", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I\\'ve ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it\\'s amazing. She\\'s amazing, it\\'s all amazing...\\n\\nDamn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.'}\n",

I\\'ve seen words like risk-taking, bold and edgy being thrown around. Bold? Gimme a break. There\\'s more boldness in the Times New Roman font. This instalment has evidently, looking at aggregated scores, polarised viewers. And I can see why. In this episode, the rebels attempt to flee from The First Order and it\\'s up to Finn to retrieve someone to help them infiltrate their primary ship. Meanwhile, Rey tries to convince Luke to help the rebels and train her in the Jedi religion. That\\'s pretty much as grand as this chapter gets. Where is the grandeur!? Where are the stakes!? Why am I not on the edge of my seat! No matter how aesthetically pleasing the visuals are, the constant feeding of nostalgia and the inclusions of a few memorable scenes...it doesn\\'t make a film great. This episode is weighed down by underdeveloped characters, sluggish pacing and pivotal elements that are rushed. I have no doubt in my mind that Rian Johnson\\'s directing style was glorious, in fact the technical aspects to The Last Jedi are outstanding. Visually I cannot fault the effects that are used and also appreciated the use of puppets and animatronics, particularly the Porgs which are bound to make Disney a fortune. Various memorable scenes, such as a cruiser lightspeeding into another ship, make for some general entertainment. But, I can\\'t shake off the fact that I was bored. It took nearly half the film\\'s runtime to get going and become interesting. Kylo Ren is the most intriguing character with plenty of internal conflict. Adam Driver gives a perfectly good performance, full of emotion beneath his eyes. I can see it! They just didn\\'t explore his character arc or utilise him to his maximum potential. The Force Awakens introduces us to these fascinating bubbly characters that are just utterly wasted in this. I\\'m uncertain about \"bold\" choices regarding Leia, Snoke and Luke...but even so, I wasn\\'t enthralled enough to care.'}\n",

Yeah, I'm old. But, I'm a little shocked at so many haters of this movie, many of you have given a 2! A 2???? Seriously?\\n\\nI've given The Last Jedi an 8. It's an epic and original Star Wars movie, with gorgeous cinematography and incredible music from the wonderful John Williams again. Rain Johnson has managed to expand the force mythology, inject some good ol' humour back into the saga, and throw in some wonderful surprises, that I believe, we all needed. It seems like many of you do not like change, or are not prepared to enjoy a Star Wars movie that takes risks. This movie takes huge risks; it dares to offer something fresh in a franchise that is over 40 years old. It also pays homage to the original trilogy in a beautiful and tasteful way. So, no, I do NOT understand the haters out there.\\n\\nNevertheless, it's not a perfect movie. There are some risks that Johnson takes, that will upset some fans, but some of those decisions have made me ponder the force in a new way. One of the main problems for me was the 'detour' from the main storyline with Finn and Rose. This storyline felt a bit sluggish, 'forced' and feels kind of shoehorned in there, and it also doesn't really serve the greater story-but then again, maybe it DOES. I will need to see it again to decide on this. There were also a handful of 'dumb' little moments, that I won't get into, and certainly at times I was reminded that Star Wars movies were originally made for children, and while we have our darker adult themes at work here (and even spiritual themes), there are also many magical moments for children. Maybe us 'grownups' need to stop taking it all so seriously and learn to be kids again?\\n\\nFor the most part, this is a solid, original and gorgeous Star Wars movie that I believe, makes The Force Awakens seem a little bland and unoriginal. Go and see it, it's the best Star Wars movie since Empire.\"}\n",

The Last Jedi is by far the most original, surprising and exhilarating Star Wars film since the Disney-Lucasfilm acquisition in 2012. It\\'s also a high point in the Star Wars saga, and I have no doubt it will be remembered as one of the most consequential chapters in the Star Wars mythos in the years to come.\\n\\nWhich is why, I must implore audiences to please please please for the love of God, avoid spoilers at all costs. If you\\'re a fan, and if you\\'re reading this before going in, then I can assure you that spoilers will most definitely affect your movie-going experience, as there is quite obviously a lot that happens in this film that has so effectively been kept under wraps for the same reason.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi could not have been what it is without Rian Johnson. It\\'s very clear he\\'s a massive fan of Star Wars, and this film is honestly more like an impassioned labor of love.

The rest of the cast is sound, and Carrie Fisher in her final role is every bit the Leia we\\'ve come to know and love, and then some.\\n\\nThe score by John Williams is wholesome. There\\'s really no other way for me to describe it. A wonderful mix of brand-new as well as familiar motifs and themes. Despite the great score and visuals, however, The Last Jedi manages to make your jaw drop several times with some of the most surprising moments in the saga thus far- there\\'s a line that Luke Skywalker says in the film, that is the title of this review and is most definitely applicable to this film: \"This is not going to go the way you think.\" And that it is not, Rian Johnson has assured that with this story that\\'s continually unexpected, a story that indeed changes the way you look at these films, which is precisely what it shares in common with The Empire Strikes Back, and that\\'s every bit a good thing.\\n\\nI am incredibly lucky to have watched this movie premiere, but I truly think it\\'s a lucky time for Star Wars fans all over.

Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi, The Force Awakens, and The Mandalorian (series) it's now time for The Last Jedi. I read tons of reviews stating The Force Awakens was the worst one while for me it was the best one. The worst one to me was The Last Jedi, it's just much too long, it has an uninteresting story with a lot of unnecessary scenes, the CGI's were good but that's only normal for a Star Wars movie, certainly for a recent one. I just feel the writers didn't know what to do at one point, it was just a bad script this time. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One and The Last Jedi, those I thought were of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and The Mandalorian, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the tenth movie of eleven plus The Mandalorian in barely five days for me, next one today will be The Rise Of Skywalker, the latest and last one in the hope it will be better than this one, looking forward to it.\"}\n",

The action was good, and the fighting scenes even better (great choreography).\\n\\nAlthough the ideas weren\\'t always original, the experience felt real. Therefore, I often struggled to control my emotions. It was the ideal farewell to Carrie Fisher.\\n\\nI mean, what more could I ask for?'}\n",

      "The force is strong with this movie!\n",
      "{'ratings': '10/10', 'title': 'The force is strong with this movie!', 'movie_id': '2527336', 'author': 'Ramascreen12', 'date': 'December 2017', 'content': 'This review is spoiler-free meaning it does not contain spoilers, but I will genuinely share with you how \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" affects me as a movie fan, as a Star Wars fan,.. and whether or not it does what it\\'s supposed to do. Audiences around the world tend to agree with the statement that \"Empire Strikes Back\" is one of the best sequels ever made, well, I think \"The Last Jedi\" can easily take that honor now. This movie is astonishing and spectacular. It pushes many of this franchise\\'s familiar elements to their limits and it really digs deep into the key characters and brings forth everything that stands out about them. Writer/director Rian Johnson is an impeccable storyteller.\\n\\nThe story picks up after the events in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" by this time the First Order grows stronger as it corners the resistance to an impossible situation. Poe Dameron, Finn and Rose come up with a plan that could work but time is of the essence. Meanwhile Rey is doing her best to convince Luke Skywalker to join in on the fight, but Luke doesn\\'t want to be a jedi or a master, let alone the resistance\\'s final hope.\\n\\nOk, so if you\\'re wondering what happens with Kylo Ren, Rey, Poe Dameron and Finn and how they affect each other this time around, without giving it away, what \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" does is essentially flesh out these characters. Not only will you get to know some of their history and their background and what truly compels them, but this time they\\'re also facing some very difficult choices. And the film also lays out judgement on some of them, it puts an end to some parts of the story that doesn\\'t need to be continued anymore in the next episode. And what\\'s brilliant about the story that Rian Johnson has crafted is that it makes you the audience think that each of those characters has their own respective path that they\\'re going on, you expect them to see it through but bam, other plans take over but turns out these new unexpected plans actually make sense to the overall arc.\\n\\nJohnson wants these characters\\' personal journeys to be a refined in the fire type of journeys. Each revelation, each aspect, brings them one step closer to being the lead stars, front and center of this new trilogy as the old icons take a step back further away from the spotlight. Speaking of whom, it\\'s so awesome Mark Hamill be Luke Skywalker again, he has a bigger role this time, such a larger than life legend, and Hamill actually gives his best performance in years in this one.\\n\\nI know that a lot of fans consider \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" to be more or less a rehash of \"A New Hope\" and I don\\'t blame them for thinking that because to a certain extent, it was a rehash. But it\\'s a necessary one because after the super boring parliamentary-heavy prequels by George Lucas. So it was important for \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" to remind us that this franchise was once super fun and exciting. So because that problem was taken care of, so now Rian Johnson doesn\\'t need to do such reminder anymore with \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\" It is not a Empire Strikes Back rehash. Rian can freely do what he does best, similar to what he did with \"Brick,\" \"The Brothers Bloom,\" and \"Looper, and that is to further explore the possible consequences of the characters\\' decisions while at the same time amplifying everything you love about Star Wars, it even brings back some familiar faces. If you\\'ve always been fascinated with the force, this movie emphasizes the force all the more. If you miss Carrie Fisher, this movie has heavy dose of general Leia, if light speed gets you stoked, there\\'s plenty of those here, and if you\\'re a big fan of jedi mindtrick, boy does \"Star Wars: the Last Jedi\" have a big motherload surprise for you or what!\\n\\nSuch incredible breathtaking new locations as well, especially that vast salt land in Bolivia that serves as the backdrop for the planet Crait. The battle sequences in this film are pulse-pounding, explosive and intense. The light saber fights are thrilling, you just get enough of it, you\\'ll be begging for more, you\\'ll want the film to display more of those laser swords in action. The way the new characters integrate themselves with the stories of Kylo Ren, Finn and Poe Cameron is quite seamless. Whatever conflicts amongst them or their collision only lead to some of this film\\'s most heroic moments which are highlighted by the remarkable sound mix and sound editing. This is a movie that entirely looks and moves and feels and breathes like a Star Wars movie with an Oscar level deeply affecting drama that stays with you long after the end credits roll. The force is strong with \"Star Wars: the Last Jedi.\"\\n\\n-- Rama\\'s Screen --'}\n",

      "Not this Disappointed Since Jar Jar Binks\n",
      "{'ratings': '3/10', 'title': 'Not this Disappointed Since Jar Jar Binks', 'movie_id': '2527336', 'author': 'view_and_review16', 'date': 'December 2017', 'content': 'I love the Star Wars franchise. I was so anxious to watch The Last Jedi especially how The Force Awakens ended and how good The Force Awakens was. I bought my tickets a month and a half in advance in anticipation of episode eight.\\n\\nAs the movie started I was dialed in for the first 15 minutes then I noticed this subtle uneasiness in me like a disturbance in the force. It began with the interaction between Poe and Princess Leia. She made a comment and made a decision regarding Poe that I found a little unsettling. \"OK.\" I thought. I didn\\'t like that exchange but it\\'s not a show stopper. The subtlety was that Leia was making it seem like the Rebels were in no need of heroes. They didn\\'t need fighters anymore, they needed thinkers (or something akin to that). I took that little shift in philosophy in stride and kept eagerly watching. A couple of other small iniquities occurred but I soldiered forth watching with an open mind because it\\'s \"Star Wars\".\\n\\nThen, there came the interaction between Rey and Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nLuke is part of movie folklore to me. Like many people have the one celebrity they\\'d like to meet: the one fictional character for me has always been Luke Skywalker. Luke was the first hero I\\'d seen wear black. He had piloting skills, light saber skills and could do Jedi mind tricks. He was the coolest.\\n\\nFast forward nearly 40 years and now Luke is an old man. So what I\\'m expecting is an older, WISER Luke. If Luke is on a deserted planet then it must be for a very good reason. And if Rey found him, much like Luke found Yoda, then Luke will have so much to impart upon Rey. That\\'s not quite what went down. They made Luke a sullen pessimistic old man that was ignorant of simple truths. He offered so little; to the movie and to Rey. He was a shell of his former self, he was only good at being the ex machina. The Luke Skywalker in this movie was NOT the Luke Skywalker I knew. The Luke Skywalker I know was killed in this movie.\\n\\nAfter seeing my fictional hero relegated to something unrecognizable I actually became bitter while watching the movie. There was almost nothing they could do to save the movie. And they didn\\'t . In fact, it got worse. By the end the movie was more of what I should have saw coming: rebels running from the Republic and figuring out some remote yet heroic way to ward them off. And what added to the annoyingness of this movie is that they didn\\'t know when or how to end it. What should have been the end was followed up by another half an hour mini movie with its own beginning, middle and end.\\n\\nBut unlike The Last Jedi I know how to end this post. Don\\'t waste your time.'}\n",

Not that i haven't seen all the movies , rather i am a real fan of star wars movies and i have seen all old and new movies very attentively. Also enjoyed those as well. But to me this is the movie of near perfection and ultimate action to go for.\\n\\nThis movie is about a suspenseful united adventure of rey and Luke with other companions after their entry to jedi world. This adventure is full of twist and turn and sets a real exciting space opera of high voltage conspiracy , actions including different space instruments and arms, and overall a composite world of fantasy and drama. Their adventure brings many past secrets to light and many hidden facts are revealed by this.\\n\\nThe movie is not absolutely concerned with actions and fantasy but it has a good build up of story around a very good plot and the acting as well as the direction , special effects are reasonably well performed.\\n\\nThose who like to watch fantasy movie will obviously like it. But it is the star wars lovers who will enjoy the most.\"}\n",

To many mistakes were made, no questions were answered, as if they just do not care, which is probaply the case. Even Mark Hamill said that he did no like what they did for the original charakters. It sometimes reminded me a lot of the prequels from the early 2000s, so I can not rate this movie higher than 6/6.5!\\n\\nTLJ leaves you not wanting to know how the story goes on from here. I simply do not care since they failed to make the new charakters more intersting!\\n\\nI defently will not watch the next movie at its premiere, instead I'll wait till its out on Netflix!\\n\\nDissappointing!\\n7 out of 9 found this helpful.

      "(1, 4154796, 140440117311280, \"But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...\\n\\nThe past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.\\n\\nTo me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.\\n\\nAnd the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.\\n\\nTo me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.\\n\\nIt seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents about any of them\", '7/10', 'April 2019')\n",

      "(7, 4154796, 140440117307344, \"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.\\n\\nOn the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.\\n\\nAvengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.\\n\\nOf course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.\\n\\nLastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10\", '10/10', 'April 2019')\n",

This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.\\n\\n2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.\\n\\n3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.\\n\\n4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.\\n\\nCons: 1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.\\n\\n2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.\\n\\n3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.\\n\\n4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.\\n\\n5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.\\n\\n6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.\\n\\n7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.\\n\\n8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.\\n\\n9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.\\n\\n10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch.

Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.\\n\\nFirst of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.\\n\\nVisually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.\\n\\nStory-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).\\n\\nThere's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned.

Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.\\n\\nOne of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.\\n\\nFurthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.\\n\\nAnother major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.\\n\\nDespite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.\", '5/10', 'June 2023')\n",

Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.\\n\\nOne of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.\\n\\nAang: \"I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.\" Katara: \"What is it?\" Aang: \"Will you go penguin sledding with me?\"\\n\\nMoreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.\\n\\nOverall, Netflix\\'s adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.\\n\\nRating: 6/10.', '6/10', 'February 2024')\n",

I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!\\n245 out of 406 found this helpful.

Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it\\'s because of some of the changes they made to the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.\\n\\nHonestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it\\'s absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.\\n\\nRegarding the script. Sure there\\'s occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet \"You are the bad guy\" and too many mentions of \"we need to save the world\". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There\\'s even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn\\'t exist in the original. Or perhaps there\\'s a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.\\n\\nPeople say the humour and charm are gone but they\\'re wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there\\'s still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it\\'s kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.\\n\\nI\\'m often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.\\n\\nI\\'m happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.\\n\\nIf the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I\\'m a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.\\n\\nThe people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership.

You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.\\n\\nWhat I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?\\n\\nThere are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.\\n\\nMy advice for you is just enjoy it.

The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!\\n\\nAang's character is told through other people instead of him being it.

But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role.

When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way.

I decided to check on one of the writers and listened to her story about how she got into the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a fan fiction and rom-com enthusiast, and was solely focused on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the brainstorm room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics affected the show.\\n\\nThe live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out by lazily cramming in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang, chopping and mixing up the reunion with Bumi and the Gaang, expunging developed habits like Katara's nagging and Sokka's negative thinking, rewriting Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim, politicizing an ancient Earth Kingdom legend, revealing Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself too early, cutting out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding, deleting subtleties like Katara's necklace that affect Pakku's arc, swapping Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance, disclosing the comet that was part of an investigation, etc.\\n\\nThere is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. From playing with his airball buddies to losing them due to his avatar status to shirking his duties says a lot more than delivering a speech. This happens in each episode if not in every scene, but it does seem to happen in modern television, so the fault lies in the writers and maybe the editors. By choosing the least creative path, you are robbing the viewer the chance to fantasize and to be fascinated. There is no shame in following the superior version down to its dialogue and screenplays.\\n\\nAaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. It should be clear by now that you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.\", '3/10', 'February 2024')\n",

They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original.

Showing that being the avatar is not all fun and games and antics, it's also not about facing dangers alone. The bending in this is a thousand times better than what Shyamalon did, at least these people kept the bending art, even make it a little more realistic with movements.
